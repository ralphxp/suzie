Penis envy
From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
Jump to: navigation, search
For the Crass album, see Penis Envy (album). For the Virgin 1 documentary, see ....Envy.

Penis envy in Freudian psychoanalysis refers to the theorized reaction of a girl during her psychosexual development to the realization that she does not have a penis. Freud considered this realization a defining moment in the development of gender and sexual identity for women. According to Freud, the parallel reaction in boys to the realization that girls do not have a penis is castration anxiety.

In contemporary culture, the term is sometimes used symbolically or metaphorically to refer to the idea that women wish they had a penis, or to refer to anxieties between men about the size of their genitals.

[edit] Freud's Theory

Sigmund Freud introduced the concept of a little girl's interest in—and envy of— the penis in his 1908 article """"On the Sexual Theories of Children,"""" but did not fully develop the idea until substantially later in 1914 when his work On Narcissism was published. It was not mentioned in the first edition of Freud's earlier Three Contributions to the Theory of Sex (1905).

The term came to significance as Freud gradually refined his views of female sexuality, coming to describe a mental process he believed occurred in girls as they passed through the Electra complex from the phallic stage to the latency stage (see Psychosexual development).

In Freud’s psychosexual development theory, the phallic stage (approximately between the ages of 3.5 and 6) is the first period of development in which the libidinal focus is primarily on the genital area. Prior to this stage, the libido (broadly defined by Freud as the primary motivating energy force within the mind) focuses on other physiological areas. For instance, in the oral stage, in the first 12 to 18 months of life, libidinal needs concentrate on the desire to eat, sleep, suck and bite. The theory suggests that the penis becomes the organ of principal interest to both sexes in the phallic stage. This becomes the catalyst for a series of pivotal events in psychosexual development. These events—known as the Oedipus complex for boys and the Electra complex for girls—result in significantly different outcomes for each gender because of differences in anatomy.

For girls:

    * Soon after the libidinal shift to the penis, the child develops her first sexual impulses towards her mother.
    * The girl realizes that she is not physically equipped to have a heterosexual relationship with her mother, since she does not have a penis.
    * She desires a penis, and the power that it represents. This is described as penis envy. She sees the solution as obtaining her father’s penis.
    * She develops a sexual desire for her father.
    * The girl blames her mother for her apparent castration (what she sees as punishment by the mother for being attracted to the father) assisting a shift in the focus of her sexual impulses from her mother to her father.
    * Sexual desire for her father leads to the desire to replace and eliminate her mother.
    * The girl identifies with her mother so that she might learn to mimic her, and thus replace her.
    * The child anticipates that both aforementioned desires will incur punishment (by the principle of lex talionis)
    * The girl employs the defence mechanism of displacement to shift the object of her sexual desires from her father to men in general.

The offshoot of these events, often cited in the media and colloquially, is that a girl really wants to become her mother, so that she can control her father.

A similar process occurs in boys of the same age as they pass through the phallic stage of development. The key differences being that the focus of sexual impulses need not switch from mother to father, and that the fear of castration (castration anxiety) remains. The boy desires his mother, and identifies with his father, whom he sees as having the object of his sexual impulses. Furthermore, the boy’s father, being the powerful aggressor of the family unit, is sufficiently menacing that the boy employs the defense mechanism of displacement to shift the object of his sexual desires from his mother to women in general.

Freud thought this series of events occurred prior to the development of a wider sense of sexual identity, and was required for an individual to continue to enter into his or her gen",1.0

The tangential forces (Coriolis and Euler) can be applied to a system but they don't occur naturally apart from perhaps in electromagnetism, but that is off topic.

During the last week there was quite a bit of discussion going on about the Euler force and the oriolis force along with false allegations that I was confused between the two.

We can apply a Coriolis force or an Euler force to a system if we like. The Euler force will increase the angular acceleration and the Coriolis force will change the direction of a constrained co-rotating radial motion.

In a rotating frame of reference with non-uniform angular acceleration there will be a fictitious Euler force acting tangentially.

In a Keplerian orbit, there will be zero tangential acceleration, although it is possible to see that this zero is the sum of an ongoing equal and opposite Euler force and Coriolis force.

Having said all this, tangential forces are not highly relevant to this article. They could be mentioned in passing but the article is about a radial force. The centrifugal force is an outward radial force.

More attempts should be made by the editors here to concentrate on differential equations in the 'radial distance' variable.

 Dubious claims about clearly non-transgenderd people 

This article lists a whole bunch of people whos transgender status is clearly wrong and others for whom it is highly speculative.  This isn't a list of people who """"kinda, sorta, there's a small chance, maybe"""" are transgender.

The ones who cross-dressed for some nefarious/deceptive purpose and not as a life style choice clearly can not be classified as transgender and should be removed from the article completely.  The fact that mythological figures such as Achilles were even added in the first place says a lot about the POV pushing of the people who supported it.  The only mythological one who might be considered transgenderes is Guan Yin.  The real life figures who did it to disguise themselves to avoid something (e.g. military service) or even to get into something where women are discriminated against.  They did it for deceptive purposes as well, so they can't really be considered transgendered.

The pope one is laughable and definitely should be removed.  The one about Joan of Arc is based exclusively on an accustion from a unreliable source.  If they accused her of being a witch, should we have included her in a list of witches too?  Also, I'd like to see an authoritative source showing that she was even accused of it as it seems that it's most Wikipedia ripped sites and LGBT websites that site that as fact.

And what are """"transvestite tendencies"""" in reference to Ed Wood?  You need to start citing sources or I'm just going to start deleting them.  That goes mainly for the historical and mythological figurse section.

Maxwell Klinger wasn't even a real transvestite, he only did that so he'd get a section 8 and get kicked out of the army.  Anyone who watched the show knows he would try all kinds of crazy stuff to get kicked out under the guise of being mentally ill.  This phrase describing the character is also very odd: """"Although a transvestite, he loudly denied any charges of homosexuality.""""  What's the association between the two?

Also, it appears they're using a warped definition of transgender here.  I've never heard a definition that would automatically include cross-dressers as if that automatically means they identify with the opposite gender rather than just enjoying the clothes.  I'm sorry, but this overly broad and incorrect definition of transgender is obviously an attempt just to make the list as long as possible.

The scapegoat/excuse being used by these meatpuppets is wrong as it is outrageous. Members of the Ryan family are alive and well. 

Supporters of Ronald Ryan will forever unite on the facts of his case and execution. We will continue to contribute the facts, based on the hundreds of references that diagree with Richards personal views. Facts like: There is no scientific evidence whatsoever to prove Ryan fired a shot. 

To put it bluntly, the meatpuppets refuse to allow any contributions on the facts of the Ryan case. Their hatred for Ryan is rather sick and disturbing to say the least.

Hi,

I think that you should reformat User:Shanes/Why tags are evil#The vandalism protection tags (or at least the idea) into some sort of proposal to reformat multiple distracting protection tags to less distracting corner icons; for example, redirecting  to  (well, probably move the later to the former, for this case). The corner icons work beautifully, are much less distracting, and clicking them will follow you to a page explaining what the lock is for.

I fully agree that the large box with text is very distracting and unnecessary. This is especially true when non-user Wikipedia users read the articles, which probably constitutes the majority of Wikipedia readers. They probably don't care that they can't edit the article, nor would they, and of most concern—they may confuse the tag with the article content.

2. Said IT professional has to make some major changes to the MediaWiki system currently hosting WP. 
Changes would include but not be limited to:

   a. BLPs must be heavily restricted and protected, or better yet, removed entirely.

   b. A proper set of guidelines for editing and administration should be enacted AND ADHERED TO. 
      This would include limitations on the powers of all administrators, and requirements for editors to be
      personally responsible for whatever they do on the wiki. No more IP-address editing. Anyone seeking
      to write for WP must apply and be approved. NO PERSONS UNDER THE AGE OF 18. """"Assume good faith"""" my ass.

   c. ALL administrators must be elected by OPEN BALLOT, by the editors whose work they oversee.

3. Most critical to the project's success: certain untrustworthy administrators MUST BE REMOVED and 
banned from WP PERMANENTLY. This would include but not be limited to:

Reply from ColonelHenry
I have been pissed this week, I admit. Why?
 First, last week, I get harassed by one hypocritical """"rule nazi"""" editor taking things too far (SummerPhD) so when I pointed out her similar shortcomings and intransigence and said frankly """"this user is an asshole"""" and explain why and state """"this is the kind of user that drives editors away from wikipedia"""" I get blocked for 24-hours.  I say """"asshole"""" once, I get blocked.  She calls me a """"dick"""" over a dozen times, and gets warned.  Go figure. I hate nitpicking rule nazis because they end up proving themselves to be hypocrites, and unfortunately without fool other meek fools who tend to be admins tend to side with the rule nazi.
 In the midst of that Daniel Case continued to plow ahead insisting on a rushed revision of ALONJ that no one else raised as a concern (so, not immediately dire) after being asked first politely and respectfully several times to """"wait until after TFA"""" and he still ignored it.  If someone politely asked me to wait a few days before doing a drastic edit on an article they worked on that was getting a little attention, I would...because I find it akin to telling a concert pianist to change their entire concert programme an hour before the recital. Only when I responded in anger did he pull back on the reins and realize """"hey, maybe I should wait till after TFA.""""  A little deference on his part would have gone a long way.  I'm not averse to his edits, but seriously, after TFA would have been more than fine.  I considered it insulting, and his refusal to listen to a polite request stated by both myself and the other major contributor to the article was considerably disrespectful.
 And then when the article I've worked on becomes TFA we get inundated with constant vandalism and petty edits that were not necessary (i.e. people like you, Kevjonesin, insisting on 19th instead of nineteenth).  Is that really a necessary place to make a stand and pick a fight? Seriously, don't you have better things to do with your time?  I'd rather argue over an analysis of Hegel's influence on Nietzsche's """"Will to Power"""" or Hindu mysticism in Eliot's Four Quartets than bicker about things as meaningless as whether honour should be spelled -or or -our.

As for why, I like """"nineteenth"""" as opposed to 19th, several style guides (including Chicago/Turabian) advocates it, and growing up I was taught that all numbers under 20 should be spelled out. Whether cutting two dozen letters from an article going to 19th and 20th is going to make a difference for """"brevity's sake"""" on a 40-page article, is a lame claim and frankly a waste of time for both of us. I like the aesthetic of it spelled out, it's allowed, and the option of spelling it out is a bonus in an article to avoid confusion with too many other numbers.  When considering such an unnecessary subjective edit, deference should be made to style set by the editors who spent months on an article...and when nothing is wrong to it, deference is entirely warranted.  That isn't ownership, it's just courtesy and good judgment. After all, if I stood in your yard while you were painting your house gray and proceeded to insist you to paint your house orange, you'd tell me to """"kick rocks.""""

"Paleontologists agree that organic remains must be buried quickly so they can be preserved long enough to be come fossilized.  However, the term fossilized is not a very precise term.  There are several factors and metamorphic mineral processes which occur to organic remains that result in what is typically called a fossil.  One major factor concerns what kind of organisms are to be fossilized  vertebrate, invertebrates, radiolarians, sponges, plants, pollen, foot prints, etc.  And multiple processes may include permineralization, recrystalization, carbonization, replacement, dissolving, diagenesis, etc.  Talking about fossilization is a complex issue, however quick burial is not questioned.

The major question is, how long does it take for these processes to work on organic reamins in the environment they are found in?  Experimental taphonomy has resulted in an assortment of remains becoming fossilized by various processes in the lab, which of course implies that given the right conditions, vast ages are not an issue.  The metamorphic processes are ongoing until an equilibrium is met between the chemical enviroument of the burial site and the minerals of the organic remains.  Flood catastrophic geologists do not expect that organic remains buried during the flood were completely fossilized within the one year period of the flood, but rather that there has been some 4000 years for the processes to have been working.  Much more work needs to be done on the taphonomy of organic remains.  Yet, how one interprets even those results will depend upon which world view you choose to believe with.",0.0

Double Standard reloaded
Who is interested in debating and who is not?
Who is interested in developing the article and
who is interested in freezin it to death, including using threats and veiled censorship in the form of selective double standard applying of internal rules?

After all, it never too much to remind that:
an editor besides not been unwilling or unable to counter argue, over a year and a half, he also have done baseless statements about editions done by me in a certain rude tone,
During all this time, I have responded to him in the same mode, but especifically to these assertions,
not having any left unanswered, unlike him...
...and only me is who was warned and blocked
Curious...
  

""""Summary of operations""""
To the newcomers in this discussion and also to the selective forgetful ones:

See above The heart of this Case;
As well as the sections Spurious Quotations, Once Again, and sections Warning to Judge by yourselves II in my Talk Page;

To note that 
1) from grammatical objections to the size of version that I propose, no one objection was left standing and even so it continues to be reversed, 
even taking into account that the present version: 
incurs spurious quote in the 1st paragraph, 
too detailed and redundant information (for an article that are supposed to be short...) on the 2nd paragraph, 
and incomplete besides be longer, vague and non neutral in the 3rd...

2) How not to think in double standard when:

The last disruptive revertion, besides be longer than the version I propose, was based entirely on incorrect inferences and historical misconceptions as I shown above (again... See above points A to E in """"Once Again"""" section ) that were related only to the 2nd paragraph (of the version I propose);
and that
No word was uttered against or about the spuriousness that was purged of the 1st paragraph, as well as against or about the 3rd paragraph, that according to some editor (Ctr F on word """"solid"""" to see above, on the discussion about grammar in the """"Once Again"""" section), was """"pretty solid""""...

And even so, the revertion was done...

So, I again ask you all:

1) Is the spuriousness justifiable under any circunstances?

2) In the case of an encyclopedia that is intended to be free and neutral, which group of honest editors would admit the use of partial referrals that lead to political and historical inferences in favor of a political regime (monarchical, military, etc.) whatever be?

Worse, which group of honest editors would allow the use of spurious citations of a partial source for purposes mentioned above - even if this purposes are involuntary, although the time that passed without actions having been taken, as well as the resistance to remediation maintained, only makes this possibility (of involuntariness) unlikely???

3) Which group of honest editors, ladies and gentlemen, who were truly committed to the freedom and neutrality of such instrument, would vote against such remediation or would omit about it?

"""Note from the subject book::

Śrīla Prabhupāda-līlāmṛta:
«And he did not have to flatter anyone, support anyone, or manage anyone's life. His mind and intelligence were free and dwelt constantly on his service to his spiritual master. He saw his present circumstances as a preparation for a greater task before him. Despite his advanced age, he felt that he had barely begun his work. Yet he felt confident. He had his vision of a world association of devotees. It was not an idle dream, although he was not certain how it would all come about. But he knew his duty. For the present he would go on describing his vision, the vision of his predecessor spiritual masters, in articles and books. But as soon as possible he should go to the West. Westerners, he had concluded, were not satisfied with a materially comfortable life devoid of spiritual understanding; more than his fellow Indians, they would be open to the message of the Absolute Truth. He knew he should go. And he would go-if Kṛṣṇa desired.

Abhay lived frugally in Vṛndāvana, keeping exact account of every expenditure and every receipt. He carefully kept a ledger, just as if he were running a substantial business, even though his purchases were only a little milk, a few vegetables, charcoal for cooking, bus rides, and his major expenditure, postage.
-
Abhay composed a Bengali poem, """"Vṛndāvana-bhajana."""" Its opening stanzas were especially self-reflective and personal.

I am sitting alone in Vṛndāvana-dhāma.
In this mood I am getting many realizations.
I have my wife, sons, daughters, grandsons, everything,
But I have no money, so they are a fruitless glory.
Kṛṣṇa has shown me the naked form of material nature;
By His strength it has all become tasteless to me today.
Yasyāham anugṛhṇāmi hariṣye tad-dhanaṁ śanaiḥ:
""""I gradually take away all the wealth of those upon whom I am merciful."""" 
How was I able to understand this mercy of the all-merciful?»

Śrīla Prabhupāda is here in the ADVANCED AGE of 61– his supporters, friends and family left him broke.

Śrīla Prabhupāda-līlāmṛta another reference:

«Prabhupāda's most ambitious literary undertaking, the completion of Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam, was to be no less than sixty volumes. He had begun in India in 1959, and all along he had been aware that he was attempting a gigantic task at an advanced age. Now Kṛṣṇa was giving him opportunities both for writing Vedic literatures and for travelling, and he was working at an amazing pace.»

Prabhupāda is here in ADVANCED AGE of 63 starting to write his Bhaktivedanta Purports – I guess in India it was an advanced age, but not in Florida.

That is to leave the 3rd paragraph of the lede as is until objections/suggestions for improvements are proposed and approved by peers before edits are made to it, which is also according to Wikipedia guidelines for resolving conflict resolution. If you familiarize yourself with this from the Talk page, you'll observe that this is a case where certain editors continually make changes without discussion, without explanation, without stating their objections first, without submitting their proposed changes to peer review, and in direct defiance of the express will of most editors that this be done to resolve the warring. I am enforcing that majority will and implementing that solution, because despite my repeated requests for moderation and intervention from administrators, I have received absolutely no help to get this taken care of. If you would kindly just enforce policy and help the majority of editors to implement the agreed-upon solution by blocking those who continually edit the article while being completely unwilling to follow policy guidelines and make a reasonable effort to seek peer approval for changes.",0.0

(Ivo Banac)...A bit of nonteleological history
One of the great problems is that our understanding of the common and individual histories of the South Slavs and the other peoples of southeastern Europe has not significantly benefited from critical historiography. This is because nationalist historiographies regularly have explained modern developments as an aspect of unilinear design. We have been taught to see connections that may be of our own making. For example, if we look at a current political map of the area and compare it to that from the era of settlements we will see that the present political divisions do not correspond to those from the early medieval period. Croatia is mainly a coastal area from the Rasa River in Istria to the Cetina River, a little bit to the east of the city of Split. Down the coast from the original Croatia, we have a row of unfamiliar Slavic territories that Constantine VII Porphyrogenitus, the tenth-century Byzantine emperor-historian, called Pagania (literally, land of the pagans), Zachlumia (most of present-day eastern Herzegovina, with the Croatian peninsula of Peljesac), Terbounia (the Trebinje area of eastern Herzegovina, with Dubrovnik and its eastern coastal environs), and Dioclea (the southern portions of contemporary Montenegro with the Bay of Kotor and the northwesternmost portions of present-day Albania around Lake Skadar/Shkoder). Serbia is located in the hinterland of Zachlumia, Terbounia, and Dioclea, its center around Ras, near today's Novi Pazar, in the Sandzak. Bosnia was apparently within this territory, but represented a negligible area around the source of the Bosna River, where we now find Sarajevo and its environs. And Dalmatia? In the tenth-century this was a necklace of Byzantine-ruled Roman coastal cities and island territories, from Krk in the north to Ulcinj in the south.

Moreover, modern territoriality required a tradition that was itself a product of modernity. Thus, unrelated traditions were merged to produce an idea of ethnic-as opposed to cultural-continuity. The Croat historical tradition goes back to the Chronicle of the Priest of Dioclea (a twelfth-century text from Bar in contemporary Montenegro) and its various translations (for example, Marko Marulic, 1510), which were in turn incorporated into the Early Modern """"Slavic"""" and """"Dalmatian"""" histories of Mavro Orbin (1601) and Ivan Lucic (Ioannes Lucius, 1666). These works then became material for the Croatianizing work of Pavao Ritter Vitezovic (Croatia rediviva, 1700), who was the most important influence on the revivalist generation of Ljudevit Gaj (1809-1872) and that of postrevival integral nationalists like Ante Starcevic (1823-1896). Curiously, the same histories (Orbin's) were Serbianized through the translations of Sava Vladislavic (1722), which then influenced the pioneering Serbian histories of Jovan Rajic (1794), and were Bulgarianized in the history of Paisij Hilandarski (1762). The Bosnian historical tradition was somewhat more self-contained. It combined the Franciscan memory of medieval Bosnian statehood with the experiences of Muslim ayan (notable) selfrule to argue for a uninational Bosnia (for example, Antun Knezevic, whose book was published between 1884 and 1887).

Clearly, something has happened in the span of ten centuries. Pagania, Zachlumia, and Terbounia have disappeared. The center of Croatia has migrated from the Adriatic to the north, into medieval Slavonia (literally, Slavic land), with Zagreb at its head. This happened in stages. During the High Middle Ages, the heart of Croatia was on the Una River, now in northwestern Bosnia. This territory (Turkish Croatia) was lost to the Ottomans in the sixteenth century and became a part of Bosnia. During the Habsburg reconquest and the concomitant Venetian operations in the seventeenth century, the framework of modern Croatia emerged in two extended shanks-one, to the north, to modern Slavonia; the other, in the south, in modern Dalmatia. At the same time, the Zagreb area, which was only dubiously Croatian in the early Middle Ages, became the heart of modern Croatia.

The story of Serbia is not much different. Serbia first migrated to the coast and assimilated Dioclea. Then it moved to the Ibar-Morava valleys; then toward the valleys of Struma and Vardar in Macedonia. It reached the Danube only as an Ottoman vassal in the fifteenth century. And its modern capital, Belgrade, became truly Serbian only in the course of Karadjordje's uprising in 1806. Bosnia, too, expanded under Ban (or prorex) Kulin (r. 1180-1204) into the Donji Kraji (literally, Lower Lands) around the Vrbas River and the Soli (literally, Salt Lands; for centuries, Ottoman, then modern Tuzla) and Usora, in its present northeastern corner. Later on, at the height of its power in fourteenth century, Bosnia expanded into Hum (Herzegovina) and the Drina River valley. The westernmost regions were inc",0.0

Where before Schengen you could renew your visitor visa by simply leaving and re-entering the country you were teaching in, now you must apply for a work permit, which is a costly and difficult process for Americans and Canadians.  Now, because of Schengen, Americans and Canadians are no longer welcome in Europe to teach English. I have heard of many well intentioned ESL teachers who were travelling between, say Germany and Czech Republic and did not have the proper 'poste Schengen' visa documentation: they were arrested by the police and forcibly stuck on a plane back to America.  No sympathy for their situation, no regard for all their belongings in their flat in Prague, no concern whatsoever: they were treated like criminals breaking the law.  This is the ugly side of Schengen: it is used to keep North Americans from teaching English Europe.  The good old days are gone, replaced with aggressive border police who are looking for ESL teachers to arrest and deport.  Many English schools in Prague, for example, are complaining bitterly against Schengen, because the companies they teach English at want Americannot BritishEnglish teachers.  Further: if you are staying over 30 days on vacation in Europe you will be treated like a criminal because of Schengen: you only get 30 days to visit Europe...then you must GET OUT: or, you must get a travel visa for every single European country you are visiting.

 Germany -  four entries 

You did not respond to my argument at all - please read it more carefully:

The IOC cannot be seen as the single authoritative source on this article, as the IOC itself does not publish all-time tables, and publishes only unofficial tables per single Games. Therefore this article is in violation with WP:No original research! The official source for the German National Olympic Committee (DOSB) does list the Olympic Medals for Germany from 1896 to 2012 → .

There were no official country codes before 1976: Only in 1976 did the IOC start to assign standardized codes. Before that time, the local Organizing Committees of each Olympic Games had chosen codes, often in the local language, resulting in a multitude of codes.

At the Games of 1956, 1960, and 1964 the German team was simply known as """"Germany"""" and the usual country code of (GER) was used. Yet, the IOC code EUA is currently applied in hindsight in the IOC medal database, without further explanation given. 

Yugoslavia does not exist anymore as a country - the FRG does. The (FRG) Federal Republic of Germany did not cease to exist. It was a simple code change, same country, same NOC. NO alternate NOCs: EUA, FRG and GER have always had the same German National Olympic Committee (NOC) recognized in 1895, same NOC President (Willi Daume, 1960–1993), same Olympic Committee located in Frankfurt - only the codes have changed. Germany is officially still called (FRG), the Federal Republic of Germany - it's the same country, with the same NOC since the first modern Games held in 1896 - only the GDR had a separate NOC, because it was a separate country (although not recognized by Germany). """"West Germany"""" did never exist, and is nothing more than the common English name used for the Federal Republic of Germany or FRG. The """"enlarged"""" Federal Republic of Germany (known simply as """"Germany"""") is thus the continuation of the pre-1990 Federal Republic of Germany - the very same country, with the same National Olympic Committee since 1895.

 It seems edit-warring is back 

Long time no see. Unfortunetly, I am here once again to say user """"Ninguém"""" is once again edit-warring my edits. Funny, I have been out of Wikipedia for some days (too busy) and while I was out, user """"Ninguém"""" almost did not post anything in Wikipedia. Now that I am returning, the user seems to be once again active in Wikipedia. It's incredible how fast he is able to edit an article I have recnetly edited. In a few minutes, he's there posting or reverting something. When I am not posting in Wikipedia, he is not posting too. 

I think it's clear the other user follows my edits. It's also funny an user who claimed to not to be associate with Wikipedia, who seemed to be leaving the projective, is once again active (only because I am returning). With hundreds of articles in Wikipedia, it seems the other users is only interested in the articles I recently posted. This is really strange. I try to be far from the other user, but it's impossible because he follows me and spends hours a day checking my recent edits. Please, do something aboout. It cannot keep this way.   """,0.0

Hi, you recently commented on bible-verse articles, and may therefore be interested in commenting about a proposed policy covering roughly 50 specific verses:

 Ubuntu Logo 

Blu,

I noticed you changed the logo for the Ubuntu Linux User Box.  Why?  The usage policy on Ubuntu's offical site clearly allows for such use. Besides, the logo is just that, a low-resolution image of a logo, which is allowed under fair use.  I am aware that some discussion has been going around about """"fair use"""" images in user boxes. If you changed the logo to Tux because I labeled it as a fair use image and not with some other licensing information, I'm sure I can find an appropriate image copyright tag.  
At the time I had changed it, several ongoing discussions had indicated that copyrighted images and logos available under fair use were not to be used in userspace, per Wikipedia policy. The Ubuntu trademark policy may allow it, but Wikipedia policy (per WP:FU is to limit images that are not available for commercial use - which the Ubuntu trademark policy explicity disallows.  | (talk) | (contribs)  The preceding text was copied from User talk:Jcarroll

I am fully aware of the above policies, thank you. I do not feel that it can be considered a personal attack, or incivil, to call a troll a troll.

Connecting the dots isn't allowed, I'm afraid. It's called synthesis and is considered a form of original research, which is against our policies here.

"And 

Paganism

Southgate, who has a degree in theology and religious studies from Canterbury University, rejected Catholicism and moved towards neo-pagan and heathen groups that are ‘very loyal to the Gods of the Northern Tradition’, including the Odinic Rite, the Tribe of the Wulfings and the A ´ satru´ Alliance, a pagan movement concerned with practising rituals and magic and led by Valguard (Mike) Murray, a former member of the American Nazi Party.91 Further evidence of this transition from Catholicism to paganism emerged in an interview with Wotan, the organ of the Charlemagne Hammer Skins.92 Southgate believed that Wotan’s celebration of the heroes of the Norse pantheon represented ‘the most genuine expression of European spirituality, culture and identity’.93 Another key expression of this ‘identity’ is exhibited by Southgate’s interest in the militaristic cult of Mithras and the ‘pagan spirituality’ of the apostate Roman emperor Julian II.94

This rejection of Christianity has an avowedly antisemitic dimension. Through the figure of Christ, Christianity has Judaic roots and is therefore irredeemably tainted; only the ‘weak’ continue to worship a ‘dead Jew’.95 The emphasis on the Judaic roots of Christianity, however, is regarded as of secondary importance to its usurpation of the rituals, sacraments and hierarchy of the ancient pagan solar religion Mithras, which was introduced into Iran and India by marauding Aryan tribes from the Russian steppes between BCE 2000 and 1500 before spreading to the Roman empire. Although it failed to defeat early Christianity in the battle for religious supremacy during the fourth century, Mithras continues to be viewed by esoteric thinkers (including Evola and Jung) as an alternative path the West could have followed. It retains its appeal as an initiatory cult or aristocratic order akin to the Knights Templar or, latterly, Himmler’s SS which, the NRF claims, had its origins in various ‘Anarchist droite ’ circles l e the Black Sun and the Thule Society. While Christianity tried to neuter this vital expression of the ‘Aryan psyche’, the awareness of Europe’s ‘Faustian’ destiny is currently enjoying a renaissance within the occult milieu. These ideas were also absorbed by thinkers like Evola and Rene´ Gue´non who discerned in them the fragments of a ‘hidden albeit distinct and fundamental truth’.96 For Southgate, as for Evola, Tradition is an ‘an underlying current which both permeates and transcends all’.97

Southgate’s discovery of Evolian ‘Primordial Tradition’ and his consequent rejection of Catholicism as ‘the sole cosmological truth’ ran in tandem with his immersion in the industrial music scene.98 This ‘cultural vanguard’ is spearheaded by a number of Gothic-Industrial, Dark Ambient, Black and ‘Viking’ Metal bands, including Allerseelen, Blood Axis, Burzum, Current 93, Dark Holler, Death in June, Endura, Mayhem, Ostara, Puissance and Sol Invictus, though it also encompasses more commercial bands like Cradle of Filth.99 Although it would be an exaggeration to say that these groups conform to a defined political agenda, their music serves to diffuse the ideals of Mithraic paganism and Nordic folk myths within this youthful underground subculture far more effectively than any number of meetings and marches could, thus providing the ‘perfect antidote’ to the spiritually enervating, multiracial values of a globalizing ‘system’. Southgate has also noted the potential of the Straight Edge punk movement and its hard core of puritanically intolerant followers, an interesting development given (exaggerated) reports of an emerging ‘anti-anti-establishment’ pro-Bush right-wing punk movement.100 Although Southgate realizes that the groupuscular right cannot control music-orientated youth cultures, he believes a minority can be induced ‘to take a direction basically conducive to our aims’.101 Southgate seeks to do this through his online magazine Synthesis, which features a music section replete with interviews and gig reviews.102

This is not simply cynical manipulation. Southgate appears genuinely interested in the counter culture he seeks to target. His fanzine, Tribal Resonance, ‘the voice of the racial avant-garde’, reveals Southgate’s strategy of linking his ideas to ‘the common language and the big ideas of our culture’.103 Through the medium of musical subcultures and the creation of alternatives ‘from without’, Southgate hopes to permeate existing political subcultures transversally, as the Nazis did, through a process of ‘cultural osmosis’ that aims to recode the ‘social symbology’ of the host culture so that its ideas can metastasize throughout the body politic, recalibrating its genetic inheritance. By creating ‘cultural hegemony’ the groupuscular right believes it can forge the ‘political space’ necessary for political and racial hegemony.104

"""
 Trimming sounds fine, but where a dispute comes up, I would recommend slowing things down.  Focus on one or two specific quotes, and if someone reverts, instead of immediately reverting back, try to come up with a compromise version.  Ditto with the other person reverting, instead of immediately pushing the article back to your own preferred version, try to come up with a compromise.  With each person changing each other's work, rather than reverting, it will probably be much easier to try and come up with a consensus version. Also, use clear, calm, and neutral edit summaries, referring strictly to the article, and not the editors.
 In terms of refactoring, what I was referring to was cases where a particular editor was being referred to.  When a post is phrased such as """"You did this wrong"""" or """"He is unwilling"""" or """"He's just always stubborn"""", then that's getting away from discussing the article content, and is veering off into discussing the editors.  Better is to try and phrase talkpage posts without referring to editors.  Good habits to develop (though they can take  time to get the hang of it), are to avoid the words """"you"""" and """"your"""". Also, avoid naming specific editors in a post, as that often has the immediate result of making someone defensive, and then they may miss everything else that's said. Instead, when it is necessary to refer to a specific thing that was done, diff the edit without mentioning the editor.  Like, """"I disagree with this edit (diff), as I feel it's a violation of (policy/guideline).  A better way to handle things would be (suggestion)""""  I know it may sound a bit confusing to do this, but I have seen that using this kind of third-party discussion technique, can work wonders in de-escalating disputes.  It also tends to make whoever is using the technique, sound extraordinarily calm and thoughtful, even if off-wiki they may be hopping mad. ) It also has the added benefit of making things much easier for administrators to take action.  When an uninvolved admin comes to a page in dispute, and they see everyone yelling at each other, the admin normally assumes that everyone is a bit in the wrong.  The admin won't care """"who started it"""", they'll just address things as they see them in that moment.  But if an admin comes to a page and sees five editors discussing things calmly, and one editor being uncivil, then it makes it much easier to figure out how to reduce the disruption.  Caveat: Just because one editor is being uncivil, doesn't necessarily mean that they're in the wrong.  But if the discussion has degraded to the point where all they're doing is name-calling, rather than actually discussing the article, then that's a problem that an administrator can easily address, by removing the non-constructive editors from the discussion. onka """,0.0

Intellectual critics saw in these actions a want of guiding principle and a lack of solid theoretical knowledge. """"He believed in knowledge just so far as it was convenient for him to justify his own theory that knowledge was a deception,"""" Henry Adams wrote in a much-quoted analysis in 1870. """"He believed in common schools, and not in political science; in ledgers and cash-books, but not in Adam Smith or Mill; as one might believe in the multiplication-table, but not in Laplace or Newton. By a natural logic he made of his disbelief in the higher branches of political science a basis for his political practice, and thus grounding action on ignorance he carried out his principle to its remotest conclusions.""""Henry Adams, """"The Session,"""" North American Review, July, 1870, p. 36.  But in a very corrupt time, it spoke well of Boutwell that nobody thought that he made money out of his Cabinet post, either for himself or his friends. Living within his salary, he lodged in a boarding-house throughout his tenure. His only pleasures lay in writing lectures and playing billiards or poker   though never for money.

Hi David,

Thanks for taking the time to write such a thoughtful analyis at Talk:DepoProvera. (And for reminding me it's Guy Fawkes!)

I feel that I don't need to assure you that I will not be offended in any way if you restate your position from our earlier discussion re Pfizer/LaCroix/BMD in the current disputebut just in case, please be assured that I will not.

I will be slow-to-respond/disengaged on the Depo talkpage, in hopes of keeping things cool, while still continuing to advance the discussion. There is no hurry and deadline, after all.:-)

I don't know if you've been following the discussion at Emergency Contraception, but MastCell's first post to Depo occurred less than 30 minutes after the conclusion of this exchange: . It seems unfair to accuse him of harassment or wikistalking, but it also seems to me that he arrived at Depo already quite upset/confrontational, etc.    Because there is even the possibility that there is a causal relationshipi.e., he is angry re EC page and following me to Depo, (and Dalkon Shield) to express animosity, I think it is better that the Depo discusssions involve plenty of input from other editors.

There already is separate article on Martins which makes reference to the Bank of Liverpool but it is not well sourced and could be made more comprehensive.

I propose continuing the Bank of Liverpool history to 1928, when the name was shortened to Martins, and possibly beyond.

How should the overlap with the Martins Bank article be treated? The name change to Martins is really a red herring - it is the Liverpool entity which was dominant and provided the continuity until its acquisition by Barclays and therefore I suggest should be the main article.

Hi, I have't forgotten that you wanted to discuss a bit further. I'd like that too. I'm on sort of a semi-Wiki-break right now, but, in the meanwhile, could you elaborate on
By the way, I'm interested in seeing (if you have an example in mind) an illustrative example of leveraging basis elements of a complex space that square to -1. That sounds like an interesting benefit that might normally be passed over in pure math texts.
a bit. I'm not sure exactly what you mean, and there might be no mathematical significance, but there is surely physical significance to be extracted. The complexification is made partly for convenience, partly for the Clifford algebra to actually encompass the physicist convention for the Lie algebra, and partly to encompass transformations that come from , not . Actually, not even the full  suffices. In order to encompass time reversal, one must have the set of all antilinear transformations as well. These are constructed using complex conjugation and an ordinary complex linear transformation. Best!",0.0

 Mediation 

Hello, I am Atyndall and I have volunteered to take on your mediation case, during this discussion I will remain neutral with both sides of this argument and will endeavor to solve your dispute. After having a look at the discussion above, this is what I have found:
QuizzicalBee has been adding the sentence """"According to Chesler, the the U.S. embassy repeatedly refused to help her leave the country as they no longer recognized her as a U.S. citizen."""", Hurmata has been reverting this back to """"She reports that the U.S. embassy repeatedly refused to help her leave the country. Hurmata objects to QuizzicalBee's sentence as he/she thinks that the source is incorrect as the guards would have allowed Chesler into the embassy and first hand accounts from Chesler herself does not qualify as a reliable source. QB objects, saying that maybe in the 1960s US citizenship could have been revoked by the US/Afgan government at that time and perhaps in the past the guards may have denied entry and that her claim should have been presumed true until proven false. Hurmata countered that the citation threat QB was referring to is not the one that was cited. QB states that there is no evidence disproving her claims, so they are valid.

Yes it does make sense. Of course you left out the context of my question which relates not to the general point of wiki but to the bias of some users (you) to which links they want to see. We already know you alone claimed the first link was spam and you removed it on that basis. Even users who don’t think the link should have been there agreed it was not spam. So your poor judgment is not in doubt. Your following days of rant showed your true reason for not wanting the link, it was because you didn’t like the idea of the site also selling hotel rooms. The link to the visitor centre is still there by the way, which shows it was regarded as being a legitimate item to link to. My point still remains that if its worth linking to the first link was far more useful to the general public.

 Disruptive Activity 

 Please stop your disruptive editing. If you continue to vandalize Wikipedia, as you did at Paracetamol, you may be blocked from editing.    🍌 (email) 

Yeah, so I add two interesting and important new, relevant references to an article which indicates potential harm to pregnant women on the Paracetamol page. These are removed because you guys don't like primary sources? This is ridiculous and frankly an extreme case of what is wrong with Wikipedia. My wife is pregnant. I for sure want to know about potential harm of this drug. I would think as a medical professional that you would be more inspired by the """"first do no harm"""" idea. The fact that you Wikipedia jerks are so focused on having only sources from a narrow range of whatever it takes for a given article is so frustrating. I've continued to run into this kind of thing. You would think that academic journals have taken over Wikipedia. The idea that I have actually improved the article with my additions, and that others can improve it further, has completely escaped much of the Wikipedia culture these days. Wikipedia has simply forgotten the idea that this is collaboratively edited, rather than having a coterie of people who simply reject all edits if they do not thread the eye of the needle through the dozens of acronym style guides. You guys are disgusting, really. You are standing on the shoulders of millions of edits and now you reject the very thing that got you to where you are, namely lots of collaboratively edited small improvements. Now any change has to go through hurdles that would never have created Wikipedia in the first place. The fact that you have excluded something that is evidence of significant danger to pregnant women based on this culture of exclusiveness should trouble you deeply.   

 I'm sorry that I've upset you, but the fact is we get hundreds upon hundreds of poor quality changes every day. That is why we've written WP:MEDRS which I pointed to when I reverted you. There is also an excellent essay on why we adhere so strongly to it at WP:WHYMEDRS. The fact is that many primary studies are either performed on mice or on very small populations so that their results can't be transferred into clinical practise. MEDRS is no catch all, but it helps us and makes patrolling many articles and removing citations from the daily mail easier. I would also like to point out that we are working on getting these types of warnings into our articles automatically, for example by having FDA warnings automatically added.

I understand it may feel as if you're being reverted by a faceless mass, but I assure you if you had simply taken up the discussion it would have been far more likely to be productive.   🍌 (email) 

 This isn't about my feelings, it is about your behavior. You revert me with no reason, then start quoting this bureaucratic nonsense, then threaten me with banning due to my disruptive editing.

Speedy deletion of Spunga
 A tag has been placed on Spunga, requesting that it be speedily deleted from Wikipedia. This has been done under section G4 of the criteria for speedy deletion, because the article appears to be a repost of material that was previously deleted following a deletion debate, such as at articles for deletion. Under the specified criteria, where an article has substantially identical content to that of an article deleted after debate, and any changes in the content do not address the reasons for which the material was previously deleted, it may be deleted at any time. 

If you think that this notice was placed here in error, you may contest the deletion by adding  to the top of the page (just below the existing speedy deletion or """"db"""" tag), coupled with adding a note on the article's talk page explaining your position, but be aware that once tagged for speedy deletion, if the article meets the criterion it may be deleted without delay.

Worse, which group of honest editors would allow the use of spurious citations of a partial source for purposes mentioned above - even if this purposes are involuntary, although the time that passed without actions having been taken, as well as the resistance to remediation maintained, only makes this possibility (of involuntariness) unlikely???3) Which group of honest editors ...who were truly committed to the freedom and neutrality of such instrument, would vote against such remediation or would omit about it?'

Mr. Davis,

Thanks for your note on my talk page; I really appreciate it, and it's an honor to receive communication from the author of such an important book.  As this article's creator and main editor, I'm sorry that you thought the review section was so negative.  Please understand that it was not my intention to present it that way or that I was in any way trying to disparage your book.  In my rush to get the article published, I did a google search and those are the reviews I found.  Also please understand that this is a Wikipedia article, and the article as it now stands will never be """"complete"""".  It's a work in progress.  I thought an article about Street Gang was important enough to get out there.  I am by no means a professional writer, so I'm certain there are all kinds of weaknesses about it, so I depend upon the feedback of other more experienced editors.  I would've thought that the other sections of the article demonstrates my respect for you and for your work.  I appreciate your feedback, something I always welcome as a Wikipedia editor.  If you are aware of other sources that I wasn't able to locate, please send them my way, on my talk page.  I'll repeat this message via your webpage, to ensure that you see it.

You should also know that I've taken it upon myself to improve all Sesame Street-related articles on Wikipedia.  It's a big project, and a great need.  For example, Sesame Street, at one point was actually a featured article, but it was recently downgraded for some really good reasons.  It's an unfortunate state at the current time.  Your book came out shortly after I took on the project, so it's been a boom for me.  I thought focusing on the history of the show was a natural place to start, so your book has been a valuable resource.  I've already started working on this article: History of Sesame Street, and if you look at the reference section, you'll see that I've used your book extensively.  It's also a work in progess, and no where near finished.  My goal is that at least this article get up to featured article status by Sesame Street's 40th anniversary in November.  I can't tell you how much your book has helped me.

On a personal level, I wanted to tell you how much I enjoyed your book.  It was a fun read, and immensely interesting.  I was brought to tears many times, especially when I realized while reading about all that Joan Cooney and her team did to get the show on the air.  See, I'm turning 45 this year, which makes me old enough to be the first audience that watched it.  I had to put the book down to compose myself when I realized, """"They did all that for me!""""  I appreciate learning about the struggles they all went through to affect my life so profoundly, and now the life of my own children, who are severely developmentally disabled and love the show as much as I did and still do.  I believe that Sesame Street deserves high quality articles on Wikipedia, and I've taken it upon myself to help accomplish that.  If you, as the ultimate expert, could assist me in that goal, I can't tell you how valuable that would be.  Again, thanks for the feedback and communication.   """,0.0

 The EU  A 'German Ploy'? 
This might be worth mentioning in this article: many people in Eastern Europe (and elsewhere [i.e. France, Russia, those Europeans countries that refuse to join, many others]) believe that the European Union is nothing more than a 'German ploy' to 'control' Europe both politically and economically (given that Germany is the most economically powerful and populous member of the EU).  They say that the success of the EU obliquely fulfills the Third Reich's burning desire for Germany to become """"The Undisputed Masters of Europe.""""

You think PSP Wiki is have trusted sources? Its copy of Wikipedia and users are adding information not Sony.  
In PSP Wiki is written: The latest reported firmware version shipping pre-installed on new PSPs is 5.50 (confirmed by a few people who buyed a PSP-3000 Special Edition (Harry Potter Version).   
This have trusted sources???: (confirmed by a few people who buyed a PSP-3000 Special Edition (Harry Potter Version)?? OH YES SONY CONFIRMED THAT!!! OR WHAT?? [and even world bought is written wrong]  
Actually a new PSPs have a version 5.70 or higher. Even in Wikipedia is written: [5.70]This firmware is only available pre-installed on new PSP-N1000 (PSPgo) models and cannot be downloaded. SO ARE YOU BLIND OR WHAT???!!! AND HOW CAN BE THIS POSTED IF IT DOESN'T HAVE SOURCE?  
And 5.70 is also installed on new PSPs 3000. I can confirm that. On PSPs came with limited edition GT bundle. I bought one.(already sold it because its not hackable)

Batista = Whines too much about his position in the company and should shut his mouth. Fuck him, job him out to JBL. I use to like him but he has main evented more than Cena and is in a better position than he should be just because of Triple H.

Orton = Does whatever the fuck he wants because he is a main star and friends with Triple H. Should have been fired already for smoking pot in front of everyone. If it wasn't for Triple H, he would be jobbing in TNA right now. Fuck him, that son of a bitch does not deserve the spot he has. He is good of the mic but ring skills lack, headlock after headlock. They compare him to AJ Styles which is a joke in my opinion since AJ has pure wrestling ability.

Triple = Been playing politics for years and deserves to become a jobber for the people he has buried. He tried to keep Booker T and Kurt Angle down. Angle is one of the best wrestlers and if you watch his match with Abyss at Turning Point; which I can give you a link, it is worth the watch trust me; is still doing great things. Booker T deserved a hell of alot more than he did in WWE. I can't stand him and I hope he gets hit by a car.

 Worst Season ever 
Anyone who likes Seasons 4 and onward have obviously NOT seen any of the old episodes from 1999-2004 and therefore is a total dickbag. I can never tell you how much I HATE the new SpongeBob!!! Nick had stopped caring about good animation and started caring only about the cash the SECOND they started this show. The old ones are great, while the new ones, I'd give an F plus 500 million minuses! I'd be so damn shocked if anybody even likes these new episodes, because anyone who does is downright retarded. It's like all Nick's staff wants to do now is win themselves a bunch of hot girls!

When the stooges at Nick began this show, it was nothing but great humor for 5 years. Now, SpongeBob's crew had lost ANY sight of what """"good quality"""" is all about! The writing is totally fucked up! I mean, Seriously, """"For Here or To Go""""? Who the fucking hell would watch an episode about taking orders at a fast food restaurant deciding whether or not to eat it at the restauraunt or home? I know there are now just copying off ideas of old episodes. Ex: Petsitter Pat. Patrick says the bath is gonna come to Gary. That's EXACTLY what SpongeBob said to Gary in """"Gary Takes a Bath"""", but that version is WAAAAAAY better than this new junk that anybody likes is mentally challenged and obviously hasn't watched the first three seasons! Even true SpongeBob fans should only like Season 1-3, because no episodes past that were even remotely decent. And I know for a fact it will never be as good as it used to be. I'm 100% certain that is true. ANYBODY who likes anything of the Post Movie era is just either brain-dead or childish. Stephen Hillenburg really knew quality, but now we just have a bunch of screwed-up polesmokers who only want the money. And NOTHING else! They're just like fucking Mr. Krabs clones! Paul Tibbit must be drunk or something, and Tom Kenny must have swallowed a slide whistle, because now SpongeBob is ABSOLUTELY NOTHING EXCEPT FOR UTTER GARBAGE THAT IS ALL BUT INTOLERABLE!!! Like I said, I cannot believe there are people that actually LIKE these new episodes! Everybody that likes Seasons 4-8 smoke too much crack! Anybody who's into the new SpongeBob doesn't know shit about quality if it hit him square in the ballsack! All I can say is, I am SO RELIEVED this show is ending in 2014. Only 2 more years of this trash that I will have to sit through! If they make a SpongeBob Channel, they should only do reruns of the first three seasons, because absolutely nothing afterwards was good. So there goes 7 years of my life I know I will never get back. I am not going to wait too much longer for them to cancel this unfunny garbage, because it needs to happen soon.71.74.87.105

Not at all, you are making a straw man argument here. I never claimed O'Donohue had that position, rather that practitioners and researchers in the field ignored the DSM position, which is exactly what the quote says and also something O'Donohue agrees with.

Bullshit. """"His corkscrew senton finisher hasn't been called the Cancun Tornado"""". Why the fuck would you argue if you don't have your facts straight? Watch iDia de los Dangerous!, I guarantee you they name the move at least five times during the event. The fact that Ultimo Dragon uses the name for a different move doesn't matter. For example, in wrestling, for years and years, the name """"Last Call"""" was synonymous with a fallaway slam, but that didn't stop TNA from giving that SAME name to a superkick. Sometimes two different moves have the same name. The guys name is Human Tornado and apparently they thought that the move name Cancun Tornado fit his characters name, even though the move wasn't a corkscrew moonsault. PWG has named the move (multiple times) and therefore it should be in the article.

Please consult the article Ball culture, which states """"drag queen, or transgendered"""". WP:OR does not cover synthesis by bringing two facts together.

Legally, how is it possible for a private citizen to violate another private citizen's civil rights?
I don't know if this is the section Nelson was charged under in the federal case, but if anyone could explain this, I would appreciate it.

You can argue whether or not the outcome of the state murder trial was justified, that's really not my concern here, since it's a dead letter.  I'm concerned about whether the subsequent civil rights prosecution was legal.  If the state murder acquittal was a miscarriage of justice, it's not the first time.  Look at Issei Sagawa.  Part of having a mature understanding of this sort of thing is to realize that the criminal justice system isn't perfect, and that it is inevitable that innocent people will be convicted, and that guilty people will be acquited, from time to time.  That's the price you pay for having a legal system; in the end someone has to make the decision, and sometimes they may not necessarily get it right.

 Armour 

A source that is not listed as an inline citation in an article is not a reference, it does not point to any specific text in the article. It is """"further reading"""" material unless it can be used to verify text. 

Notes and References
Shortcut:
WP:FNNR

Notes and References appear after See also (click on image for larger view).
Main page: Wikipedia:Citing sources#How to format and place citations
Contents: These sections present (1) citations that verify the information in the article, and (2) explanatory notes that would be awkward in the body text. Some articles divide this type of information into two or more separate sections; others combine it into a single section. There is no consensus establishing a particular structure when footnotes and the works cited in those footnotes are placed in separate sections.
Title: The most frequent choice is """"References""""; other articles use """"Notes"""", """"Footnotes"""", or """"Works cited"""" (in diminishing order of popularity). The title """"References"""" may be inappropriate if the section contains both explanatory notes and citations. Several alternate titles (""""Sources"""", """"Citations"""", """"Bibliography"""") may also be used, although each is problematic: """"Sources"""" may be confused with source code in computer related articles; """"Citations"""" may be confused with official awards or a summons to court; """"Bibliography"""" may be confused with a list of printed works by the subject of a biography. With the exception of """"Bibliography,"""" the heading should be plural even if it lists only a single item.[9]

Further reading
Shortcut:
WP:FURTHER
A guideline on further reading sections is proposed at Wikipedia:Further reading.
Contents: An optional bulleted list, usually alphabetized, of a reasonable number of editor-recommended publications that would help interested readers learn more about the article subject. Editors may include brief annotations. Publications listed in Further reading are cited in the same citation style used by the rest of the article. The Further reading section should not duplicate the content of the External links section, and should normally not duplicate the content of the References section, unless the References section is too long for a reader to use as part of a general reading list. This section is not intended as a repository for general references that were used to create the article content.

After reading the explanation for the deletion, I'm not sure whether Amcom really has enough notability or not. However, if we do want to make an Amcom page we will have to supply some secondary sources to justify the company's notability.

Canadian Ethnic Studies Journal,  Spring, 2001  by Monica Boyd,  Doug Norris]:

 """"At the close of the twentieth century, """"Canadian"""" has become the fastest growing ethnic origin group, up from 0.5 percent in 1986 to nearly 4 percent in 1991 and to 31 percent in the 1996 census of Canada. From what groups did this """"indigenous"""" label draw in the five years between the 1986-1991 and the 1991-1996 censuses? Using unpublished tabulations from the 1986, 1991 and 1996 Canadian censuses, this paper traces temporal shifts for a cohort of the Canadian-born age 25-44 in 1986 (and age 34-54 by 1996). We find that most of the increases between 1986 and 1991 in """"Canadian"""" ethnic origin responses are accompanied by intercensal losses in British origin responses. Between 1991 and 1996, increasing Canadian responses went hand in hand with dramatic losses in both the British and French ethnic origin counts. In some provinces, notably the Prairie provinces of Alberta, Manitoba, and Saskatchewan, shifts also occurred out of other ethnic groups.""""

I was originally unsure of the motives of this editor - why they were completely desperate to delete or move this article - until I noted they were interested in Tamil subjects, one of which is M.I.A. (artist), and guessed that they believed that the two could be confused.  Their subsequent creation of the article M I A as a redirect to M.I.A. (artist) proved this, as far as I am concerned.  

As to whether the band is actually called MIA or M.I.A., it differs.  The band itself uses M.I.A. as the heading on their own website, but then uses a combination of both elsewhere.  Since in the case of most sources, this is only likely to be laziness (much as R.E.M. are regularly referred to as REM), and since the article has existed here for a while, and that all the backlinks go to this version, and most of all because we shouldn't let disruptive users get their way, the article should stay here.",0.0
"""

 as daft as it sounds yes, if it cant be verified it gets removed plain and simple i suggest you reread these core wikipedia policies wp:truth wp:verifable wp:rs wp:nor and wp:nor i hav enot intentions in edit warring with you over it but be warned since it isnt sourced anyone can remove it and report you for vandelism. (talk - contrib) 

 (As it says on my talk page, I prefer to have discussions all in the same place. I am watching this page, so please reply here. To this end I have taken the liberty of moving your previous reply here.)

 So if I add a statement that there are no vacuum tubes in SSDs either, you'll insist on a source for that too? 

 Seriously, you are mistaken on a few points. I think you need to read WP:VERIFY yourself: 

  All material in Wikipedia mainspace, including everything in articles, lists and captions, must be verifiable. All quotations and any material whose verifiability has been challenged or is likely to be challenged, must include an inline citation that directly supports the material. Any material that needs a source but does not have one may be removed. (emphasis added - jeh) 

 Note the distinction. You wrote """"if it can't be verified it gets removed"""". But, first, the claim that SSDs contain no disks obviously can be verified. Not only is it part of the definition of the term, the very first reference in that very article confirms this claim in its description of these devices. So, no, we don't need to cite a source for this particular instance of the claim. 

 And second, except for BLP issues, WP:V only states that unsourced material that needs a source may be removed. This material didn't need a source, and even if it did, it isn't required to remove it right away. Even for claims that really should have a citation to a WP:RS, the polite and widely accepted thing to do is to add a """"citation needed"""" template. See template:cn. This is a much less abrasive thing to do to someone's edit rather than simply reverting it. 

 I suppose you could say """"well, since I removed it, its verifiability has been challenged so now it does require a source."""" Yeah, fine. So I go to the work of adding a reference name to one of the refs that's already there, and then cite that same ref from my new text as well. No, it's not much work, but consider: Does it really improve the article to add a reference footnote number to a statement that is as obviously true as this one? Is adding that little footnote number really the best use of my time here? Was it the best use of yours? And will this little challenge you raised over a completely trivial edit and obvious claim make me feel more or less eager to contribute to WP in the future? 

 Also: In my edit I merely noted that despite the term """"solid state disk"""" there are no actual """"disks"""" inside these devices. In your edit comment you said """"since they refer to it is a disk we must to [sic]"""". Well, that is true, but my edit did not remove any reference to the terms """"solid state disk"""" or """"electronic disk"""" from the article, nor even claim that such were wrong. So your edit comment was off point and provided no valid justification for your action. 

 Finally, I must point out that you are wrong about vandalism. The fact is that edits made in good faith are not generally considered vandalism. After reading WP:VERIFY you should probably look at WP:VANDALISM:

Even if misguided, willfully against consensus, or disruptive, any good-faith effort to improve the encyclopedia is not vandalism. Edit warring over content is not vandalism. Careful consideration may be required to differentiate between edits that are beneficial, detrimental but well-intentioned, and vandalizing. Mislabelling good-faith edits as vandalism can be considered harmful. (emphasis added - jeh)

 You should probably also read WP:AGF to see what """"good faith"""" means and what you are supposed to do about assuming it.  

 In sum: Please be careful about undo'ing others' edits until you are more familiar with the actual prescriptions of things like WP:VERIFY. Consider using the CN template rather than reverting unsourced material. Please think carefully before tossing around words like """"vandalism"""". 

 And you should never have """"intentions of edit-warring"""", so the statement that you don't have any here is troubling. Why would you need to state such a thing, if not for the possibility that you might have s",0.0

 It's no wonder the main founder of wikipedia turned his back on it when it's become such a blatant travesty of the intellectual honesty it purports to espouse.

What kind of encyclopedia has articles that put forward opinion verified by echo chamber sources? If any editor attempted to put that sort of trash in Britannica they would be quickly disassociated with the publication- but it's quite apparent that Wikipedia has no controls whatsoever and has chosen to let the patients run the asylum. There is no use in attempting to run an objective and educational publication when the very people who have discredited the internet as a source of information are allowed to manipulate the site by sourcing the same intellectually dishonest sites that people use wikipedia to avoid. 

In short, explain yourselves- particularly Roland Rance, who has manipulated his position on this site to censor any points he disagrees with- all without explaining why.

 Greek love 

I'm looking for a way to extricate myself honorably from this mess. I'm leaving a note here because you closed this AfD, where I made a commitment to do as you instructed in the closing statement. There are two editors who have long sought to delete or eviscerate the article, one of whom has used a series of user names (unacknowledged on his current user page but available , so at first glance it may appear on the talk page there are more than two editors in the 'suppress' camp). I complain here about their coordination. Other editors, including  and I simply can't do it any longer. I haven't changed my position on the validity of the article, but I've been accused (on various talk pages, and never the appropriate notice boards) of edit warring, ownership, disruption, and even pedophilia by implication, all for trying to carry out what the community decided. I'm done. I need to limit my time on Wikipedia at present, and wish for that time to be spent pleasantly and productively. When I've made a commitment, though, it grieves me not to keep it. I'm not asking you to do anything: I'm just explaining why I can't keep my word as given at the AfD.   

Wow, that is a mess.Certainly no hard feelings  on my end, it is clear you endeavored in good faith to improve the article. I have found that knowing when to walk away is an essential skill, not only here but in the real world. Sometimes your presence, despite your best intentions, is harmful rather than helpful, and sometimes a dispute just isn't worth it anymore. Best of luck in your future endeavors here.

Henry has never been a fair footballer, the match has just brought to light the foul play he has ALWAYS used to get an upper hand (even the biased french and arsenal fans realise). Furthermore, the quote by Wenger that """"he is one of the fairest players I have managed"""" holds no weight since:

1) It is a biased view from a man who managed Henry for years.

2) It is a view from a man who has managed a great number of cheating players during many years at Arsenal so saying Henry is one of the fairest isn't saying much.

"There is definately a major difference between caucasian and white.  Users slrubenstein and alun are definately taking a racist stance toward this article, and both sides can throw up rules and regs set by wikipedia to hide behind and attempt to justify your points of view (cited sources or not, it's obvious your point of view determines which sources you cite, and or choose not to), but this article as it exists is just wrong.  I believe wikipedia would be better served by deleting this article, and adding a new sub-section in the races and caucasian articles if it this is not changed to reflect what 99.9% of the people on this earth consider a 'white person' to be, this 99.9% obviously not including alun & slrubenstein.  When it comes down to it, the term 'white person' can't really be defined, it's technically not a race, and any references sited are going to be garbage, as you can find hundreds of them from what could be considered reliable sources that directly defy one another.  All that could be done for this article would be to direct it towards a view that most people agree with, or delete it entirely, but as it currently exists, I say again it's a joke.  You can cite all the references you want, and state all the wikipedia rules you want, you just can't understand that what you believe just isn't what an overwhelming majority of the rest of the human race does, and as I said before, there's no way of either side proving the case for either side here, as 'white people' don't scientifically exist.  So, since you guys are obviously the type that will fight to the bitter end for some worthless cause, even though you have to know that most everyone disagrees with your understanding of what a 'white person' is, just do us all a favor and either delete this article (since there is no factual ground for either side to stand on), or just accept that the overwhelming majority of people see this differently from you, get over it, and let the majority rule on this article about a group of people that doesn't scientifically exist. /end commafest 2009",0.0

Second and third paragraphs jump around and need another copyedit. I'd put right up front that Johnson did the executive order but Congress never acted on it, then go on about how the tribe didn't accept it anyway?  Keep the chronology clearer.   (Interesting that the Coeur d'Alene article says nothing about this period, maybe finish here and add a bit to that article too... hmmm) 
From a VERY cursory review of the decision, it appears that gap between creation of the reservation and Idaho's statehood becomes significant in this case, so perhaps give us a bit of foreshadowing that this is not just a dry fact, but it's something that's going to matter.

 One Addition 

Mustafaa, I promised much more stuff but have been too busy lately.
One thing that sticks out and could be fixed quickly is the beginning of the invasion.
Yes, it is my fault for adding only the Argov incident, which now makes it sounds as if it was the main reason for invasion, which is of course wrong. So, the sentence:
 """"On 1982-06-06 Israel invaded Lebanon in response to the attempted assassination of Israeli Ambassador Shlomo Argov by Abu Nidal in London on June 4.""""
should be expanded. This is a quickie list of basic facts:
 Israel had been bombing Lebanon/PLO for months, from the air, sea and land; and preparing for the invasion (see below, they couldn't have pulled of the invasion in a matter of days otherwise.)
 There was the attempted assassination Shlomo Argov ...
 The assassination attempt was used by Begin as an impetus to shortcut the Knesset's debate and move into Lebanon without full approval. 
 Israel invaded with 60,000 troops.

I'll post links and add more explanations if needed.

History 

OldLady Productions was created in 2007, by their first 2 actors Ryan and Marco. They created OldLady Productions after their first video """" Soccer Battle 2 """".
OldLady Productions then went up to a cast of 5 people. About a year later OldLady Productions fired to of their members ( Daniel and Steven ) and got to new actors ( Marino and Gianni ).
Their most viewed video on youtube was their """" Camp Rock Parody """" video with over 125 000 views after 3 months that it was uploaded. This was a big break for them because 
they never imagined getting anywhere close to that amount of views. Although in reality it is not that many views, for a new video company it was fantastic.

Videos 

We do not know that exact amount of videos that OldLady Productions has due to the fast that they are still under construction. Here are a list of videos we are sure they have released

These movies were done for amusement purposes, before OldLady Productions commenced their actual company videos. OldLady productions is planning to create and unveil new and improved movies, starting with * Soccer Battle 3 * You may only be able to see all these videos on the official OldLady productions website. Most of these videos will not be on youtube because they are starting their big outbreak with Soccer Battle 3.

Robert Deegan 
General Liability Claims Section
Los Angeles Unified School District
333 S Beaudry Ave  28th Floor 
Los Angeles CA 90017  

Dear Mr. Deegan:

This letter shall constitute a claim pursuant to the California Tort Claims Act, Section 910 et seq of the California Government Code.

My address information in compliance with Section 910(a) and (b) is set forth above.

Per Section 910(c), (d) and (e), the date of occurrence was October 5, 2007.  I was assaulted and battered by students T and I and possibly other students at Markham Middle School, 145 W 108th Street, Los Angeles.  The Police Report is DR#071828895.

LAUSD personnel, specifically, Steven Thomas Rooney, aided and abetted violations of the Ralph and Bane Civil Rights Acts, Sections 51.7, 52 and 52.1 of the California Civil Code and Sections 242, 245, and 422.6 of the California Penal Code, by failing and refusing to report the matter to police authorities.  LAUSD violated my rights under Article I, Section One of the California Constitution to safety and my specific right to safety on a school campus under Article I, Section 28 of the California Constitution.  I have suffered physical damages and extreme emotional trauma as a result.

David Brewer and other personnel knew or should have known based upon my complaints and upon past known misconduct by Rooney that Rooney was unfit as a supervisory employee of LAUSD.  LAUSD therefore negligently hired, trained, assigned, supervised and retained Rooney and ignored my complaints about his misconduct.

LAUSD’s conduct towards me is motivated by benign neglect of complaints of discrimination, retaliation, and harassment by Latino employees, as exemplified in past incidents by Superintendent Brewer and the General Counsel’s office failing to properly investigate and take appropriate action when complaints were levelled against anti-Hispanic ethnocentric misconduct against an attorney employed by the Office of the General Counsel, and other incidents.

Pursuant to Section 910(f) this claim is for damages within the jurisdiction of the unlimited division of the Los Angeles Superior Court.

Respectfully Submitted,

Empowered by amnesty and reward
There is a brand new arbcom opened up against Coffee, a precursor of the """"disruption and drama"""" and """"utter contempt"""" that editors will now have moving forward. Mr. MacDonald cannot have it both ways: he cannot show """"utter contempt"""" for """"community consensus"""", intentionally creating """"drama and disruption"""" then two days later attempt to create """"community consensus"""". 

As I wrote in the arbcom:
""""Arbcom sent a powerful, empowering message to editors like Coffee by giving them amnesty: our community rules don't matter, and administrators will be forgiven and rewarded for blatantly breaking our community rules""""

As I learned in the KWW RFA, if editors say a blatant falsehood enough times, it becomes truth. Already people are stating that no rules were broken in the RFC BLP, when no one could argue that rules were broken, and I argue they  were broken with """"utter contempt"""".

Excuse me but I have an administrator to desysop. You will be happy to note that my focus on Scott will be minimal in the next few days, as I focus on Coffee's rich edit history.

I look forward to your comment supporting Coffee in the arbcom.  Frank Andersson (45 revisions restored):an olympic medallist for f**k's sake """,0.0

 More description of location please? 

Hello, I wondered if someone with the requisite local knowledge would please consider adding a short sentence, maybe in the description section, to explain where this bridge is? I do appreciate that its location is already described in the lead as crossing between things X and Y but if you don't already know Stockton well (or recently!) this is not necessarily all that helpful. I was wondering if you could write a more bottom-up description which says something like """"the bridge crosses the Tees at blah (or near Blah Street etc); it is A hundred metres downstream from the Foo Bridge and B hundred metres upstream from the Bar Barrage"""" or whatever, which it seems to me would nail it in more empirical terms. What do you think? Any yes, of course the maps link does nail it (assuming the co-ordinates are right!) but something in the text which helps in this way would, I think, be very useful. I may be being unusually thick  (happens all the time, actually) but on my first reading - and I was last in Stockton in 2007, you see - I was not at all sure where it was, wondering if in fact it replaced the other rather nice pedestrian bridge closer to the town centre. I cured this uncertainty by looking at the maps, yes, but the sentence I'm asking for would have given me more direct access to the knowledeg. Go on, please write it for me, you know you want to; and I will go and put the kettle on for you. Thanks and best wishes   """,0.0

"""Saab lofton was a radio personality for about two months of his before loosing his show on digital radio network. He will not provide proof of his comic roofis (as in did he actuall draw it himself or did he contract out the work while writing the storie. Both of his books (pamplets) are home published and could be considered very racist! This is not someone that has any creditibily as he has lied several times on his wikipedia page.

On June 12th, 2008 GLOBETREKER says:
This is not an example and cannot be proven that YOU actually drew THE strip.

Like I said I have been informed this comic in nothing more than 2 or 3 sheets of zerox paper stapled together. Not in the usual format as a printed affair. He uses the term loosely since it’s not a real printed comic. He has no examples of his drawing, what kind of cartoonist doesn’t put their work online. PROVE THAT SHIT!

He stated in this post to Wikipedia that his book Battle Neverending’s 3 thousand copies sold out in one year which is a total lie. He printed them in 1998 and was still selling them as recent as 2006

http://www.popocculture.com/28/battle-neverending-by-saab-l

“Jarvis Marlow is the man who paid out of his own pocket for the second printing (one thousand copies) and third printing (two thousand copies) of Battle Neverending. I sold all three thousand copies of Btl Nvrg within the span of a year”. 

(Example #1 of his lies)

2000 copies of A.D. supposedly sold in one year or as Saab states (Record Time) which is also unverifiable whether it actually sold that fast since he out an out lied about Battle Neverendings.
The first A.D. was published by a small defunct anarchist publisher which describes itself as publishing """"pamphlets"""", sold out and was not reprinted.

“However, his claim to fame is the novel he wrote while still in the dorms at San Francisco State University, A.D., which was so radical a book it got him kicked out of college in 1997.”

When in reality

“Lofton wrote """"A.D."""" while a student at San Francisco State University and spent so much time hawking the book when it was published three years ago that his grades began to fall and the university cut off his financial aid”.

(Example #2 of his lies)

I ‘m not admitting any mistake about BERKELEY (you always want to appear very radical so I’m sure you told him you were homeless on the streets of Berkeley) because you made that up as well as being homeless! The only place you’ve been homeless was on your mothers couch for THREE YEARS ALL THE WHILE REFUSING TO WORK A DAY JOB, IM SURE TO YOUR MOTHERS AMAZEMENT ON JUST HOW MUCH OF A BUM HER SON TURNED OUT TO BE!

(Example #3 of his lies)

“In all the WEEKS you've been STALKING me, NOT ONE motherfucker has so much as e-mailed me and asked, """"is this anonymous, psuedonym-using piece of shit correct about anything?""""”.

I know nobody reads your shit anyway so I wouldn’t expect any response. I write these things simply because I know that you can’t handle risking your supposed fame! (Which is all you are interested in anyway). Your not an activist you’re an opportunist masking yourself in anarchy.

And finally I have this victory over your Racist Spoiled Black Privileged ass!

Here’s the dialog about shutting Saabs Wikepedia page because firstly it’s chalked full of made up shit and secondly they finally realize that he’s just another home publishing hack!

I've looked into the books listed in the bibliography... The first was published by a small defunct anarchist publisher which describes itself as publishing """"pamphlets"""", sold out and was not reprinted. The second was described by Pop Occulture Magazine as """"obviously a low-budget and quite-possibly home-printed affair"""". There is no evidence that either of these books received a credible review, much less meet WP:BOOK. Journalists are a dime-a-dozen and not automatically notable, and these books don't appear to establish notability either.

Therefore I am proposing deletion of the article. If the tag is remove, would someone please nominate for deletion? I can't as I can't create the deletion page... 67.67.219.223 (talk) 

I'll keep an eye on it. I also find it a little hard to believe that he was kicked out of San Francisco State for writing a novel that was """"too radical."""" -) Steve Dufour (talk)

"""{{Unblock|I'll make a renewed effort not to give personal attacks. But of course I do have some questions about this unwarranted blockage, as you might well imagine:

1. Why is it that IP editors tend to get the raw ends of the deal: that you """"admins"""" tend to lean towards the side of someone who's editing with an account over someone who's editing without one, especially in the area of what you label as """"personal attacks"""" or """"harassment"""" when given by the IP-editor but not so much when the named editor does the same thing?

2. For exampleand this is... yep, maybe you guessed it... question 2: Why is it supposedly """"okay"""" (according to you) for someone with a name... like, say... escape orbit... to dish out a personal attack, but not for me to give him one back because I'm just a lowly IP-editor? Specifically, why is it supposedly """"okay"""" for him to give me a personal attack by putting false stuff on my keyboard by making the ludicrous claim that my reason for wanting the old style of """"ebaY"""" logo to go next to the current one, """"ebay,"""" in the lead, is """"because I wanted it in there,"""" even though that is a total lie; but it's supposedly """"not okay"""" for me to call that kind of slander stupid?

3. Here's another one: Why is it supposedly """"okay"""" for him and """"smiley girl"""" there to falsely accuse my edits of being """"vandalism"""" just because they differed from what these guys preferred, but then when I say their reversions are vandalism, I get in trouble for it as if it were a """"personal attack"""" just because I'm an IP-only editor?

4. Ready for one more? Then why is it fine for any of you named editors to give one of us IP-editors a warning template, but when I, as an IPer do the same thing to a named editor like I did to partially smiley girl, I get dinged with """"Oh, you can't do that 'cause that's a 'personal attack',"""" or """"Oh, that's bad because that's 'harassment' """"?

5. Oh yeah, here's one more! Remember the rule about edit-warring (just in general, meaning that it doesn't even have to be breaking 3RR) that says that """" 'but I was right, so I was not edit-warring' is no defense""""? Well then doesn't that apply to meeting some so-called """"consensus"""" too (since some things aren't cases of concrete correctness but are just based more on whether they match what that so-called """"consensus"""" wanted the thing to say)? Well then why is it that just because your named friend smiley there does some edit-warring against me to put the thing back to what your exclusive (partial) """"consensus"""" wants it to say, AND since my editing had already been established as NOT vandalism even though it disagrees, you ignore that above-mentioned edit-warring rule and give her/him a pass anyway, but when I, an IP-only editor who's against your exclusive """"consensus,"""" do the same thing, it's """"edit-warring"""" even though it was the same thing as what smiley's doing (remember the """"being-right/matching-consensus-is-no-defense"""" rule)?

 European Borders 

There is a BIG problem going on about whether Republic of Georgia and other neighboring countries should be included in Europe or not .As you know there is no official border between europe and Asia and there is a great number of unofficial versions .so you might think that it is LOGICAL to explain all of the versions that exist for today on that page..........      well sadly thats not what most editors think. they put one version there and every time I changed it, it went back to the previous version. now I am just wondering do these people think it is their personal page or what gives them the right to rely on several sources and ignore other ones that are not any less trust me. They should definately offer every version of where the border goes between the two continents instead of putting only one version  and not even bothering to explain why, it is unacceptable. I contacted one of the editors and he/she said that he chose that version because he/she """"thinks it is the most neutral one"""". I am sorry but what some users """"think"""" should be completely irrelevant while making an article on the website which has an ambition to be Credible. they should include all of the versions or not include anything at all before there is an OFFICIAL border ! Council of Europe, the oldest organization in europe classifies country as european,  country is in the middle of the NATO membership process (only european countries are eligible for it according  to the North Atlantic Treaty) and they are not even mentioning why they left it out. Turkey is not the case because it was already amember of nato. cant they understand that page is not about the EU. its the entire europe as a whole and until the borders will be determined OFFICIALLY all of the versions should be included.

"Help clarify an artice: John Stark 

I was looking for information on John Stark and came across a confusing section. In the part about his early life, there is a paragraph that reads:

On April 28, 1752, while on a hunting and trapping trip along the Baker River, a tributary of the Pemigewasset River, he was captured by Abenaki warriors and brought back to Canada but not before warning his brother William to paddle away in his canoe, though David Stinson was killed. While a prisoner of the Abenaki, he and his fellow prisoner Amos Eastman were made to run a gauntlet of warriors armed with sticks.

The problem is that there is no mention of who David Stinson is, only that he was killed. I see that an edit you made (10:57, 2006 January 25‎) removed some clarification on him, instead identifying Amos Eastman as the fellow prisoner. As you have better knowledge on the subject, can you please put back some info identifying him? (or possibly remove the unclear info??)

"Jung And Einstein 

In 1895 Albert Einstein was a pupil at cantonal school in Aarau, Switzerland. In 1896, after school in Switzerland, Einstein renounced his German citizenship. Carl P. Jung was born in in the Swiss canton (or county) of Thurgau. While Jung worked on Wandlungen und Symbole der Libido (Psychology of the Unconscious), tensions grew between Freud and Jung. 

Frank P. Geyer continued to serve as a detective until August 15, 1903 when he resigned. He had been transferred to the 18th Police District in the United States. Detective Geyer had arrested James Anderson; whether this is the same Anderson mentioned in Detective Geyer's 1896 work is non-determinable. In 1912 tensions between the two psychologists came to a peak. In 1901-02 Albert Einstein acquired Swiss citizenship and completed a scientific paper, obtaining a teaching position at school in Schaffhausen, Switzerland. 

The FBI file on Einstein came to light in 1983 when Robert Alan Schwartz wrote an article on the subject for The Nation magazine. Between J. Edgar Hoover and John Hutchison, democratic rights didn’t stop with McCarthy’s downfall nor with the demise of so-called notorious J. Edgar Hoover. Yet for years, zero-point energy according to Hutchison is obtained from the quantum vacuum. Hutchison claims on scientific phenomena are regularly featured and discussed by various media coverage. John Hutchison's claims of inventions and discoveries of a variety of phenomena are, like, NASA. The FBI should do an article on NASA and their non-determinable webers.

I do not find it too surprising Schwartz once more wrote about not only Frank Geyer, but Albert Einstein with not too much said about Carl P. Jung during these years around the turn of the centennial.",0.0

Take that section of the squid article, which admittedly is rather short, and expand upon it, just as the admins suggested. Note the number of brains, with the source information.

However, if editors came to rely on feature (1) then that would introduce a risk, because there would always be a gap between an image appearing on the main page and the bot protecting it. A clever vandal could vandalize the image in that gap. And worse, the bot would end up protecting the vandalized version of the image.

See how important reading the title, and getting the correct title is? My arguments haven't evaporated anywhere; South Ossetia is still location-based (my initial argument); it is still where over 90% of the fighting took place; it still has the most important battle (Tskhinvali); my arguments are still here buddy.

I've seen your majority view point and called it a farce many times.

My Russian colleagues may disagree, but Chechnya was not De Facto part of Russia in the 1990's, it was De Jure. And it was called the Second Chechen War, not the Russian War 1999-2006.

Second, Smith was not claiming that all self-interest has beneficial effects on the community.

Hello Barto. I am curious as to what your motivation is in editing on the Ron Gostick page and are you the creator of it?  As stated on the talk page there, you are correct in stating that internet sources which are few come from mostly the extreme right or left.  These are terms both I and Ron, himself would acknowledge as being artificially misleading characterisations and could not be ascribed to him or the associates of the Canadian League of Rights. I could explain why here, but I won't bore you with the details.

However, I do reject the notion that everything must link to a Wiki article.  I am editing at another page, where there is no objection to verifiable external sourcesinternet or hard copy. I will not object to so-called Left or Right sources, as long as there are sources from external links to associations and people connected to Mr. Gostick.  The archives at the Australian League of Rights will have plenty of published materials on him, League objectives and views or anyone associated with him. This is one link that was removed in favor of David Lethbridge's document (hardly a non-politcally unbiased character considering he represents everything the opposite of what Gostick and the League of Rights stood for).

I will try to help you find sources, fair and credible in the near future, doing edits myself.  I just want to know if you have a bias of your own or are willing to be neutral on some claims made about him.  I know well what he and the League of Rights stand for, as I have been involved with it for near 30 yrs. There is no denying he was anti-totalitarianism and that includes anti-zionist, which automatically brings down the bogus smear of """"anti-semitism' and other such nonsense.  An editor should have at least some familiarity with the subject he is decidedly determined to write about.

I have notified Paul Fromm of the wiki page and link to him at Gostick's page, in case he didn't know it existed.  Be aware that Wikipedia has come under criticism for pages created on living persons, edited by vandals with damaging false claims unknown to the subject of the article until much later.  One was a recent high-level member of the Kennedy administration and believe me he made a public stink about it.  Living or dead, I don't care to see this happen to anyone.

Pretty much what I said the first day this was posted. Now, I have neither a problem with the Cabal's decision nor in the Cabal's logic (as Deamon138 does). My concern is why a vote that basically said """"I don't know"""" means it stays at Burma. By the Cabal's conclusion...If the article had happened to be frozen at Myanmar before the mediation, and we had the same Cabal, it would now be a Myanmar article. I can see where the Myanmar side would be unhappy. However why should the Burma side agree to abide by the next decision? You can bet that with every panel of mediators that might side with Myanmar you will find at least as many panels that side with Burma. Husond is right, where does this end? When I first looked at this mess I said, and posted, that with the current evidence on both sides editors and mediators will NOT be able to reach a FAIR compromise that will appease both sides of this issue... no matter how much thought is put into it. There are good points for each argument. I'm in the Burma camp but that is how I see things. So I'm looking at 1) leave it where it is now, 2) split it into 2 identical articles, 3) some bizarre bot that switches it back and forth daily, 4) a new type of mediation that imho will not end this by any stretch of the imagination.

"""==Proposed move to Stiffness to weight ratio==

Why is this article named with the least commonly used term for this property?  Google returns 75,400 results for """"specific modulus"""", 78,700 results for """"specific stiffness"""", and 783,000 results for """"stiffness to weight ratio"""".

I could understand this if Wikipedia were advocating the term """"specific modulus"""", e.g. because it is shorter, or more technical sounding, or whatever.  However my understanding was that Wikipedia was explicitly not in the advocacy business and that its articles should be named with the commonest term.  In this case the commonest term occurs ten times as often as the other two terms.

This name has the further benefit of being self-explanatory, whereas those unfamiliar with either of the other two names would have to consult a dictionary when they encounter it in a text, which may well be why it is by far the commonest term.

I therefore propose moving this article to Stiffness to weight ratio and linking the other two terms to it.  This won't compromise findability in any way, but the choice of name will indicate the most commonly used term.    """,0.0

They provided a business case summary but not a business case that the summary was created from.  I have provided the link to the index of papers produced (mainly email acceptances/rejections of meeting appointments btw) so you can confirm that the Business case was never provided.  There are no source documents for any figure contained in the Business Case Summary.  Some of the numbers are shown as incorrect from prior and post-TfNSW publications (such as with the Capacity claimed by GB on the MR for the Modification Approval yet the actual modification report states figures that are 50% lower.).

 I am one of 8 community reps for the project and am attempting to ensure the facts are put out for people to make their own minds up about.  That is why I have tried to use as neutral descriptions as possible rather than emotive language.  The minutes for the Community Rep meeting with TfNSW are sanitised and questions asked by the reps are not recorded not responses provided to the questions.  The terms of reference (open to the public to see) for the Community Rep meetings state that all questions will be answered within a time frame yet TfNSW are refusing to do this.  I have since discovered that 4 of the community reps are current employees of the State Govt and 1 is a past (self-proclaimed) senior executive of TfNSW.  So not only do they not tell the truth - they have also stacked the Community Reference Group.

Though, I suspect you know this already.  I'm not offended though, just immensely confused as to why this item of access control must be devoid of technical information and meet some arbitrary legal standard.  I would ask you this: if a user loses their SmartCard (i.e. CAC) and forgets their password, with the premise being that biometric devices or other inherence factor methodologies are not deployed, in most situations does an administrator with knowledge of the user ask they be terminated, or do they reissue credentials based on knowing the person?  There are organizations that will terminate you, but I couldn't have said that in my expounding of the 4th factor because it would mean citing information not available to the lay. (I do hope I can """"talk"""" without citing what those in DF and IS would consider common knowledge.)  When we set out, it was to provide reliable information, if the mission has changed, well who could tell?  Consider me a non-contributor from now onwe aren't allowed to use Wikipedia anyway where I work, it is an anathema.  Say what you want unless it surprises someone and then an ego check is issued. I should expect nothing less, after all, I teach.  What changed the tone was your dumbing-down and use of nonsensical examples that could not be used to authenticate someone.  Smell?  Non-sequitur.  You gave me things to read, but I'm still waiting for you to cite Wikipedia's policy that information be legally sanctioned and in the format expected by a barrister.  I cited my sourcewhere is the citation that the language style, organization, and applicability be in-line with one or more regulatory bodies?

Now a better way to be proactive would be to realize that academic databases (do you have access to them [Elsevier, JSTOR, EDAS, IEEE, SpringerLink], they can be pricey if you try and yet without them you're stuck in a Google funk, but I digress) are full of references to fourth factor.  That cash register key the manager uses when you return something, yep, someone you know.  An that's been around for decades!  Sign up for an account with an ISP, there it is again!  Take joy in knowing you have some sheriff star and are for the most part helpful.  I just didn't realize you alone set these standards.  I repent in ashes and wrend my sackcloth accordingly.

"""

Well, in case anyone's interested in following up on this further, using the La Trobe University on-line search engine, a search for the term mahāpurisalakkhaṇ (truncated to allow for various inflections) leads to 77 (BJT) record hits, at least 65 of which are in the Pali Canon.  Here's the first page of the search results (with links to the subsequent pages as well):  http://www.chaf.lib.latrobe.edu.au/dcd/pitikaresults.php?title=&start;=60&to;=70&searchstring;=mahāpurisalakkhaṇ .  
Of course, this is by no means a straightforward indicator of how many discourses actually reference this term (nor what this term means in the context of various suttas) since multiple records can be part of a single sutta.  (Similarly, this is not a clear reflection of the total number of times that this term appears in the Pali literature as a single record could have multiple instances of the term and their might be other ways of formulating this phrase not addressed by the above truncated compound term, etc.).  
FWIW, a quick review of these results (potentially suggestive of the distribution of this term in the various nikayas) shows 40 hits in the Digha Nikaya, 15 in the Majjhima Nikaya, none in the Samyutta Nikaya, 3 in the Anguttara Nikaya, and 7 in the """"canonical"""" Khuddaka Nikaya (mostly in the Suttanipata), 5 in the paracanonical KN words (e.g., Netti, Peta), one in the Abhidhamma's Kathavatthu, once in the Visuddhimagga, and 5 times in the Pali histories.  If nothing else, this distribution perhaps suggests that suttas identified by Peter and myself might possibly be (among?) the core texts. -)

Duck Soup. I've listed this article for peer review because, even though I and other editors have contributed much information and references, I'm certain that there are other aspects of this classic film that have yet to be covered. I'd like to hear feedback from you, so that I can get help in improving this (and other Marx Brothers films) quality.
Princess Leia Organa. I've listed this article for peer review because it right now seems oddly cluttered and, despite a lot of references as of now, lacks reliable source citations.  Although I've already requested another peer review, as long as it helps the articles get better, I've got the time. Any helpful comments will certainly be appreciated, as this should help me in expanding other Star Wars-centric articles.

"Deletion of AV News page 

Just curious why the AV News page is being deleted while its primary competitor Antelope Valley Press is allowed to have its page here unmolested.

Granted we have only been in business for six years but we are every bit as a legitimate news organization as AV Press and even more so than AV Town Crier, whose page is also allowed to be here I note.

Here is the content:

The AV News began as a weekly print newspaper with emphasis on local news located in Lancaster, California USA. It was the second largest circulating newspaper in the area after it began publishing in 2006. In 2008, the AV News added a website and in March 2010, much like the Seatte Post-Intelligencer, the AV News transitioned to a web-only publication. The AV News covers the Antelope Valley area of Los Angeles County - mainly the Palmdale/Lancaster Urbanized Area (a US Census Bureau defined term) and areas of north Los Angeles and southeastern Kern counties, including Acton, Agua Dulce, Edwards AFB, Lake Los Angeles, Mojave, Quartz Hill, Rosamond and Santa Clarita. The newspaper is conservative in its political stance. It is currently the official news publication of the Lancaster JetHawks, a minor league baseball team in Lancaster.

History

The AV News was founded by Fran Paolinelli in 2006. She continues to work at the publication today. It began as a weekly print publication before dropping its print version to become a web only publication at www.avnewsday.com

The paper, conservative leaning, holds strongly held views, which can become controversial at times.

Competitors in its market are the Daily News, Antelope Valley Press and the Los Angeles Times.

External links
AV News Official Website

The format is the same as the AV Press. There is less historical info that the AV Press because we have only been going for six years and they've been up for decades. But still, we are getting e-mails from people who use Wiki to find out about the Lancaster/Palmdale area and are surprised to find out that there are more newspapers in the area than what they find listed.

I also point out that the City of Lancaster is a major advertiser with us as is the local professional baseball team.

 Colorado balloon incident 

Greetings. I reverted your addition of a news photograph of the Colorado balloon incident balloon. Unfortunately, Wikipedia's use is exactly like the commercial use for commercial news photography. As the template you used states: """"Use of historic images from press agencies must only be used in a transformative nature, when the image itself is the subject of commentary rather than the event it depicts"""".  It's intended for images which are themselves iconic works of art so that we can use the images to primarily facilitate discussion of the image. 

Even ignoring the legal problems with using the news photography: Wikipedia has a hard requirement for freely licensed images because non-free media compromises the freely licensed status of Wikipedia. Refer to the first rule at WP:NFCC; non-free images are not to be used unless obtaining a freely licensed could not be reasonably believed to be possible. There were undoubtedly thousands of photographs of this balloon taken by amateurs and professionals alike, almost any would do for the purposes of the article. Wikinews claims that the balloon was low-flying and that photographs were captured by area residents.  

The best way to get an image for the article would be to leave a placeholder in the article requesting that the public submit one. The effectiveness of such a place holder will probably diminish over time as the attention on this incident dies down. I've been checking flickr and other photo sites but have so far come up dry, though sometimes it takes a little while for people to bother uploading their photographs.

I hope I haven't given the impression that I do not appropriate your contributions to the article— as I do, especially your efforts to use even and neutral language in the face of a media environment eager to describe the parties unfavourably. Thanks for your contributions!   """,0.0

 On the way forward: consider this before posting here 

I would much prefer it if certain people did not post on this page. So, before posting please consider whether you might be described as a tendentious canvasser or drama seeker, mischief-maker, advocate, misrepresenter, someone who piles on without clue, or someone carrying over """"by association"""" the disputes that they have with contributors elsewhere. If you might fall into one or more of those categories and still think it necessary to pass comment here then please try to find an admin to do that for you (and if you are an admin - Chillum comes to mind - then find another). I'm not keen on this because it restricts collaboration but, hey, people like that basically just seem to vent, poke or offer weird """"advice"""" when I am the subject of their attention. I'm human, not a saint; while my ability to tolerate the types described above is not bad, it is also not infinite.

I'd be pleased if the time that you would have spent here is expended instead on editing India-related articles. But bear in mind that you will need to be able to:

deal knowledgeably with touchy and repetitively-raised issues such as Hindutva-, religious- and caste-related POV-pushing
handle completely clueless newbies on a large scale, many of them encouraged to edit by an ill-considered WMF initiative
handle often large-scale sock- and meat-farms, and masses of copyvio and BLP violations
take copious amounts of general abuse pretty much daily
face all sorts of physical and legal threats, both on- and off-wiki, as well as real-life stalking over prolonged periods by multiple people

All with little or no support from the WMF and large swathes of the community who are more interested in the never-ending tendentious discussion of """"meta"""" issues - among them policy, """"honor"""", and the creation of a Wikitopia - than actually improving content where it matters most.

And when you need a break from articles that relate to 20 per cent of the world's population and which suffer grossly from bias, systemic and otherwise, go chill by creating a GA or at least a B-class article more or less single-handed. Do all of this and you'll make me a very happy (and surprised) man. Do it for 130k-ish edits without getting blocked, on spurious grounds or otherwise, then you'll be really quite remarkable.

I'm not saying that I will be back but if I do return, I'd rather not see stuff here from the types of people described above. Thanks. -   """,0.0

"FK Vardar 

FK Vardar is a Macedonian Football club, the club changed its name several times during its history, from original Vardar in 1911 to Citizens Football Club Vardar or just Citizens( Gragjanski in Macedonian ) in 1920, then Football Club Makedonija in 1946 and finally back to FC Vardar in 1947. By the name FC Citizens( Vardar ) the club won 4 championships from 1936 till 1939. About Yugoslavia, you have to know that Yugoslavia was a federation of 6 Republics -countries together and each Republic had its own championship, and there was a Federal League where teams from the Republics competed together. Each Republic had its own Cup and the cup winners competed in the Marshals Cup, that cup was held in honor of Joseph Broz the marshal of the Federation, and its was called the Cup of the Marshal. How ever FC Vardar never won the Federal league ( League made of Federation of 6 Republics best teams ,thats why its called the Federal League, and not Yugoslavian League nor Yugoslavian Cup). The title in 1987 was won by FC Partizan Belgrade , you can check in any official statistics or documents. The second federal league was made of two Second Federal Leagues , East ( 3 Republics competed, Serbia ,Monte Negro,Macedonia and two Provinces- almost the same as Republics but yet without a nation ,those were Kosovo and Vojvodinship ) and West ( 3 Republics, Croatia, Bosnia and Slovenia, sometimes clubs from province Vojvodinship  would compete in the West depending on the federation decisions ). In the period of 1922 till 1929, present day Republic of Macedonia was established as 4 provinces within the Kingdom of Serbs Croats and Slovenes, those 4 provinces were Skopje, Bitola,Shtip and Vranje prvinces. These 4 provinces established the Macedonian Football Federation in 1926,and they held 3 championships. In 1929 these 4 provinces joined in one Duchy and this championship was held in the Duchy ( Banovina ) for 11 times.During the WW2 the championship was held under German Occupation, and the German government recognized this League. After the WW2 the very same championship was tranformed in to Republic Football League ,just the Province of Vranje was separated from the Republic as Macedonia transformed from Duchy to a Republic and the province of Vranje was under the newly made Republic of Serbia in 1946. The bottom line is since the Federation of 6 Republics split in the 90s, Macedonian Republic League was transformed in to Macedonian First League. So it is the same League that changed names and competition format during the decades, and now it came to this Level. Its a petty that there is lots of politics and territorial pretensions lots of denial of the existence of the Macedonia and other Republics in the Federation , by the Serbian side. Serbian official politic is to show that Yugoslavia was one country and nation mainly based on Serb character and they are stilling all the history including history of sports in this case football. They are trying to show the world that there was Yugoslav nation ( Serb ) and only Yugoslav Football league ( Serb League ) denying the Federal League second Federal League and Republic Leagues. They want to show only Yugoslav League and not the real Federal League. They hold all the champions from the Federal League as Serbian Champions in every competition. For FC Vardar at this point of view considering that  Macedonia is not in the Federetion for more than 20 years,and it wont be in the future ,the most important are the titles and trophies won in the Macedonian League , and if you wont to put additional trophies won in the Federation ,the period before 1991 you should write the precise information. Second Federal League East is the name of the competition, and you should put the Macedonian Flag from that period of the time next to it,instead of the federal flag, simply because that federation dont exist anymore and doesnt represent any country nor nation. About the cup , you should write down the real proper name as it was called ,Marshals Cup also fallowed by Macedonian flag from that period of the time, you should put a notice that in the Federal Second League East , clubs from Serbia Macedonia and Monte Negro competed including the provinces of Kosovo i Vojvodinship.",0.0

The fact that it used to be single party government is largely an irrelvance; the important thing is that it is still a constitutional monarchy, parliamentary system, that allows for both coalitions and majority rule.

I am all for mentioning Nick Clegg as Deputy Prime Minister in the article, around the same place David Cameron is currently described as Prime Minister, but to put Clegg alongside the Queen and Prime Minister on the basis of it being a coalition government is not right. Now if the job were constitutionally defined as being the Prime Minister's second-in-command, and if Cameron were to die/resign suddenly Clegg would become Prime Minister, I would completely agree that he should be there, but it isn't. Clegg may be Deputy Prime Minister, but he is not deputy head of government, and so he should not be put alongside the head of state and head of government.",0.0

 I am not sure if I understand your reply above correctly:
 UNSD uses the term  """"statistics divisions""""  ( I agree, but the term refers to division(s) in the UN headquarter or agencies in different countries, NOT a specific way of geographic divisions of the world.)
 You still prefer previous title (i.e. """"United Nations statistical divisions"""") to the current one (i.e. """"United Nations geoscheme"""")?
If so, please allow me to repeat a bit on the following:
 The term """"Statistics Division""""(capitalized singular form) in the UN context refers to the organization of United Nations Statistics Division with the website at unstats.un.org.
 The term """"statistical divisions""""(plural form) can mean any categorization schemes, not just geographical ones. Google this: """"statistical divisions"""" site:un.org
 The term """"statistical divisions""""(plural form) can ALSO mean any organization bodies who are doing statisitcal work in governments.  Google this: """"statistical divisions"""" site:un.org
Therefore, it is not advisable to use the ambigous general term """"statistical divisions"""", or the wrong organization term  """"Statistics Division"""" to refer to UN M.49 . UN statistical divisions can refer to any agencies doing statisitcal work under the UN system, or imply that there are certain UN statistical categorization schemes in a general sense (not geographical). 

I agree that UN geoscheme is widely used for stastitcs and ALSO mapping. Natural Earth has region_un and subregion metadata for each country. I use it quiet often. It is why I notice that most of academic work refer this geographic categorization/classification scheme as """"UN geoscheme"""". Try Google BOOK search and you will find at least the following:
""""The best option to identify the states from Asia could be use the United Nations (UN) geoscheme for Asia. As per this, Asia is subdivided to four broad categories:....""""
""""The UN geoscheme defines the region as all states of mainland North America south of the United States; conversely, the European Union excludes Belize and Mexico from its definition of the region ....""""
""""Country groups are based on UN Geoscheme and World Bank regional classification.""""
""""...were grouped into regions and subregions based on the United Nations Geoscheme (http://unstats.un.org /unsd/methods/m49/m49regin.htm)""""
""""... that the United Nations Statistics Division would later classify as Eastern Asia, Southern Asia and Southeastern Asia according to its geoscheme. In fact ...""""

I also agree that many UN agencies (in fact, many other reports, consultancies, etc. have different """"statistical divisions"""" (in the general sense of categorization schemes) for research. This is exactly why I believe the term """"UN geoscheme"""" is better. Although it is NOT official term or a technical term (UN M.49), I have not yet found an ambigous use of the term. Correct me if I am wrong on this, so far every online and academic citations that I have found when the term  """"UN geoscheme"""" is used, it refers to exactly the regions and subregions as defined in UN M.49 . 

Moving forwards, since don't have the time nor will to take it to RM, and if you do not have any further couter-evidence or -arguments with the evidence and claims that I layed out above, I can help by making the necessary editing without going to RM.

 Msa Garratts 

Hi,

The idea about an article is a good one, but unfortunately you've started out with an error. That is understandable as the subject is complex. 

The WAGR first imported the M class Garratts, in 1911. These are very important locos, because they are the third class of Garratt to be built, and the first """"main line"""" Garratt, showing the potential as a heavy freight hauler. They were followed up in 1912 by the Ms class, only difference being the Ms class were superheated. So they were also the first class of Garratts to be the subject of a repeat order. Both classes were built by Beyer-Peacock.

The Msa class were constructed in 1930 by the WAGR in their own workshops. Apparently a copy of the Ms class, they did seem to have some cosmetic differences.

The story does not end there, but moves to Victoria. The VR G class apparently is copied from the Ms class, the major difference is the frames moved outside so as to accomidate the reduced gauge. Outside framed Garratts are very rare, even in the smaller gauges. But wait there is more (no, not steak knives!). The design was used again, for the Australian Portland Cement's 3'6"""" line near Geelong, the first loco being supplied in 1936 and the second in 1939. The boiler from one of these locos is used on the restored G42.

So in conclusion the design was constructed over a period of 28 years, used on three railway, on two gauges and built by two manufacturers, with, if I've added it up correctly, 27 locos constructed.

Personally I think the article should cover the history of the design, and include all the varients. Some work would be required to hunt down variations, though. So yes, I think it does deserve an article.

Please feel free to use the above if you wish.

Cheers,

Michael.""",0.0

 I was thinking about this last night, and came to two conclusions: First, focusing solely on this article is not the way to go. I need to go back to square one and add academic rigor (if possible) to global warming and denialism. [Don't tell me GW is FA and is therefore academically rigorous; the FA star does not even come within discus-throwing distance of establishing an article as """"academically rigorous.""""]. Second, your system of defending this Wikipedia page (notice I didn't say """"article"""") is completely airtight, because you hold control over all of the definitions. Join any high school debate team and they'll tell you, if you own the definitions, you own the debate. And the problem here is this: you define anyone who disagrees with AGW as a """"denialist""""; and you define everyone who agrees with you as an """"expert."""" Done! The page is impregnable. Take forex the quote by Democratic Senator Barbara Boxer. Using her comments as supporting evidence of the page's (not """"article's) thesis is a flagrant act of POV that proves this page (not """"article"""") is an op-ed piece from start to end. Barbara Boxer is a politician. Every bit of power, money and prestige she has comes from her ability to do one thing and thing only: to characterize herself as a noble public servant, and stereotype her opponents as villains, buffoons or both. Even more — and this is important — Barabara Boxer is not a run-of-the-mill politician. It would be nearly impossible to find someone more unwaveringly partisan than she is. In short, the Boxer quote is another bit that does not come close to passing the """"so what?"""" test. I intend to delete that one sometime soon too. I also wonder whether I should give one of those damn wikicookie templates as a thank-you to the editors who revert me, every time they do so. Or maybe a barnstar?

""":::::::::: Tim, firstly I appreciate you taking the time to discuss this issue offline, and for your willingness to debate it at length here despite the majority view here being in your favour. Yes I certainly agree with your friend that it is very important to describe the jurisidictions that a firm is present in, there is clearly a massive diffence between, say having offices in the French or Japanese jurisdictions, or between the Chinese and U.S. jurisdictions, since the legal and regulatory systems are very different, as well as the commercial characteristics of the markets.

 Beyond that however it remains my firm view that there is a big difference between a law firm having an office in, say, Paris or Toulouse, even though they are both in the same jurisdiction. I appreciate that the situation in the U.S. is slightly more complex since you have both federal and state jurisdictions. Even within each state there will be big differences between the legal markets in different cities though. To give an example, the San Jose market will be not just a lot smaller overall than the Los Angeles market, but it will also have a quite different profile - on the whole a lot more specialist, niche and focused on high tech. 

 To give another example, in the UK a law firm could never be regarded as being truly top tier if it didn't have an office in London, even if it had offices in every other big city. In fact all of the very top tier UK firms (DLA Piper is not yet regarded as one of them, despite its size) have just one UK office, in London, although they have other offices overseas. 

 Saying that DLA has """" has 69 offices across the United States, Egypt, South Africa, Kenya, Thailand, China, ..."""" would in my view still mean a loss of valuable information to the reader. We could fall back on using descriptions like """"in major financial centres"""" or """"in major commercial centres"""" or """"in a combination of major financial centres and major commercial centres"""" but then we are introducing what is in my view an unnecesssary element of vagueness, imprecision and even original research.

 I do accept that DLA, with 69 offices, is right on the borderline of having too many offices to make it practical to list all of them in the article. However I do also feel that there is an important general point of principal that information about the office locations of a law firm is very valuable information to aid the reader of an article in understanding the subject of it, and should be included as much as possible.

OK, I'll try to sort through your latest post here. Let me know if I misinterpret something.
First, you specify a theory (axiomatic system), namely ZFC-P+""""P(P(omega)) exists"""". Let's call that T0 for easy reference.
Now you argue that T0 proves the existence of a model (let's call it M1  the 1 because it's not a model of T0, but of a new theory), such that:
M1 satisfies ZFC-P
P(omega) is in M1. Now, do you mean the real P(omega), or do you mean that M1 satisfies """"P(omega) exists""""  that is, that there's an element of M1 that M1 thinks is P(omega)?  I'm guessing the latter  that M1 satisfies """"P(omega) exists"""".
You say """"aleph2 is in the model and is less than or equal to [the cardinality of] P(omega)"""". Again I'm guessing you mean that this is in the model's opinion; that is, M1 satisfies the statement """" exists and |"""".
OK, so going with my guesses thus far, I agree that T0 proves the existence of such an M1. M1 might be, for example, M0[G], where M0 equals  (which is a model for T0), and G is M0-generic for the partial order to add  Cohen reals.

Mario Party 4 is the fourth in a series of board game style video games for Nintendo platforms, featuring popular Nintendo characters. It was released on the Nintendo GameCube in North America on October 21, 2002 strangely before the Japanese release on November 8, 2002. It was released on November 29, 2002 in Europe, being heavily criticised for being 'Nintendo's big GameCube Game' for Christmas 2002 as Metroid Prime was delayed until March 2003.

Mario Party 4 was the first Mario Party that was released on the Nintendo GameCube. Each board had its own host, including Toad, Goomba, Shy Guy, Koopa, and Boo. Mario Party 4 also contains some characters new to the franchise; Thwomp and Whomp. Klepto, Dolphin, Lakitu, and Star, along with two completely new characters named Genie of the Lamp and Ztar, are included as well. Mario Party 4 retains the Story Mode found in Mario Party 3.

The game, as usual, contains a standard party mode in which up to four players play through a board, trying to collect as many Stars as possible. The Star Space would appear randomly on the board, and players would have to reach it before anyone else. However, the Stars carry a price tag of 20 coins, and player has to earn those coins by winning minigames, which take place at the end of each turn (after all the players have rolled the Dice Block, which will always roll a number from one to ten).

Battle minigames are like the 4-player games, but generally (with many exceptions) a little more elaborate. Battle games are usually tense because every player has to put a certain number of coins (from 5 - 50) into a pot. First place gets 70% of the pot, second place gets 30%, and a random player gets any coins lost in rounding. 

Every Mario Party contains 60 to 80 minigames of a few different types. Four-player games are a free-for-all in which all players compete against each other. 2-on-2 and 1-on-3 minigames put players in groups, so they have to cooperate in the minigame to win, even though they are against each other in the main game. In most situations, winners of these games make 10 coins each.

A new addition to the Mario Party series was the Bowser mini-games. Players play in a very elaborate mini-game that ends when one player is eliminated in various ways. (See Bowser mini-game section below) The loser loses a pre-specified item, usually coins or items.

Spaces
There is various spaces you can land in the game. The following is a list of them, and what they do.
Blue Space - You get three coins. Also, there is a special feature on this game called Hidden Blocks, in which a star or coins may be hidden on random blue spaces.
Red Space - You lose three coins.
Green Happening Space - A special board event takes place.
Warp Space - You are sent to the same space as an opponent. A spinner chooses which opponent's space you will warp to.
Mushroom Space - Two boxes will appear (one big and one small). Choose one, and you will be given either a Mini Mushroom or a Mega Mushroom. (Note: The Mega Mushroom is not always in the large box, and the Mini Mushroom is not always in the small box.)
Battle Space - A battle minigame will start in which players put a chosen amount of coins into a pot. The better you finish in the minigame, the more coins you will get back from the pot.
Bowser Space - Bowser may steal items from players or a Bowser minigame may begin.
Fortune Space - A reversal of fortune begins, in which players may have to give coins or stars to others. The player who landed",0.0

Skywriter: I have tried to be civil with you.  I would ask that you return the favor.  Remember, I didn't even write the old lede; I picked that as merely being most likely to be non-controversial.  Also note that on every single edit page, there's a big statement saying """"If you don't want your writing to be edited mercilessly or redistributed for profit by others, do not submit it.""""  Part of the """"edited mercilessly"""" part is that people will criticize your writing.  It's nothing personal.

""""If you see no evidence that Kinzer's book brought about a massive reassessment of the 1953 coup in Iran, then you did not read the book or the reviews.""""

Amazon reviews are worthless for determining how important a book is, merely how good one is.  But whatever, you didn't include a direct mention in the most recent version, so let's just drop this.  (And for about the billionth time, since you mention in my edit summary that I'm """"criticizing"""" Kinzer....  I'm doing no such thing.  I'm sure the book is very good, judging from the review given by the CIA history fellow.  But """"very good"""" is not the same as """"an element of crowning importance in the coup itself.""""  People knew after 1979 that something had gone horribly wrong, so this was not a new revelation.

You said earlier that """"Your other comments are too general to address. If you would like to suggest specific changes to the wording, feel free to bring it here for comment.""""  I decided to expand on the many problems with the lede, and now it's a """"windy"""" analysis.  Got it.  But aside from sniping, you still fail to understand that my biggest problems with your version of the lede have nothing to do with sourcing.  It has to do with what information is appropriate for the lede.  There are a million and one possible, sourced facts that can be mentioned in the lede; we have to pick which ones.  I have no doubt that your text was sourced; it doesn't mean it's automatically appropriate for the lede.

Yes, and it shows just how careful were your mad rush of reverts last night. Fast and loose with facts,

Let me say it again: Are you denying that Cold War paranoia had anything to do with the coup?  Do you realize what references are for?  It's to confirm facts.  This fact is obvious and supported by every source, including your own, so it doesn't particularly matter what it was referenced to.  If you want to source it better have a blast, but this is not even close to """"fast and loose with the facts.""""

Albright's """"apology""""

You've got a point that the linked NYTimes article doesn't call it apology.  Remember, I didn't write the old lede!  Fair enough if we want to remove that due to being murkier than we'd like.

The CIA does cite vague fear of the Soviet Union in its most recent justification for the coup. However, the CIA's accounting, published in 2007, three years after the publication of Kinzer's path-breaking book (2003), must be weighed against the CIA's destruction of most of its documents related to this coup

Wait, the CIA destroyed the documents, so therefore the Soviet Union had nothing to do with it?  That logic doesn't flow.  More to the point, the idea that Cold War machinations were behind the US involvement is in literally every source.  I haven't read All the Shah's Men, but from your linked book review (the one by a notable person, not from Amazon reviewers), it seems to be in that, too!  I quote..

Eisenhower and his secretary of state, John Foster Dulles, were dedicated to rolling back communism and defending democratic governments threatened by Moscow's machinations.

Kinzer depicts him as beguiled by a moralistic John Foster and a cynical Allen.

By ignoring the anticommunist basis of US policy, he wrenched the dispute with the AIOC out of its Cold War context and saw it only from his parochial nationalist viewpoint. Lastly, Mossadeq's naïvete about communist tactics led him to ignore the Tudeh Party's efforts to penetrate and control Iranian institutions. He seemed almost blithely unaware that pro-Soviet communists had taken advantage of democratic systems to seize power in parts of Eastern Europe. By not reining in Iran's communists, he fell on Washington's enemies list. https://www.cia.gov/library/center-for-the-study-of-intelligence/csi-publications/csi-studies/studies/vol48no2/article10.html

....yeah.  As a reminder this is from a review of your favored source.  (Also note that Dulles is described as """"moralistic,"""" i.e. interested in stopping the communists, not greedy / interested in oil.  Squares with what I know of Dulles anyway.)

"Records of Awesome Editors Who Truly Want To Help==

'As this is not a study of people's hesitancy, it is not a suitable source for claims about the reasons for people's hesitancy. It would appear to be at best a study making claims about vaccines themselves, not a study about hesitancy or about controversy. If this study is the reason for people's hesitancy, then we should be pointing to a reliable third-party source that states that it's the reason, not to the study itself. If we say people stopped going to the beach because of the film Jaws, we use as a reference the source that makes that statement, not the film itself. So no, it's not a reliable source for what you claim you want to use it for. Nat Gertler (talk) 

That has got to be the clearest explanation yet. So what you are saying is cite a source that says there is controversy over the vaccine schedule because there is a correlation with infant mortality, then cite both sources? Or should I use opinion pieces like most of the other references in the article? Even the journal of medicine piece is an opinion piece. Is this where wiki gets the facts, from opinions, then excludes peer reviewed journal articles because it is WP:OR? It is built by popular opinion of the editors, from opinion pieces, not allowing facts...if this is indeed true....though I hope notDcrsmama (talk) 
No, I'm not saying cite both sources. References are there to verify the facts that are being stated in Wikipedia's voice. If the statement being sourced is that there is a controversy due to correlation with infant mortality, then we cite a source that is discussing the controversy - there is no need to cite the study. Even if the source says that there is a controversy because of this particular study, we might mention this study in the text, but the study itself is not reference for the statement. And I am addressing the specific request for input that you made in your initial posting. If you have concerns about the other sources in the article, you may wish to raise them in a specific post about the specific concerns. Nat Gertler (talk) '

I don't think the definition from Webbs really works given the change that has happened since it was first written (1917) . The idea that professionals """"supply disinterested counsel and service to others, for a direct and definite compensation, wholly apart from expectation of other business gain"""" is a bit naive, particularly in the I think a more realistic and up to date defintion is required.
For instance, in the light of Holocaust, in which many German professionals acted as instruments of a disfunctional state, which would tend to indicate that """"service for others"""" may not be have the intention, but was taken to a tragic extreme. Likewise the recent financial crisis would tend to indicate that profession of banker (if it is a profession) has shown to conducted wholly for business gain (i.e. higher profit, larger bonuses), whilst other professions have shown themselves to be very interested in business gain, often to the detriment to the business (e.g. accountants in the Enron scandal).

"In history there could be a consensus view or a mainstream view, in theology there is no mainstream or consensus view, since most of theology depends upon the church membership of the theologian. Historical scholarship aims at universality and objectivity, while theology makes no such claims. It is true that there are millions who believe that JEDP was birthed in hell (or would believe it if they knew what JEDP means), so in principle their view is notable, but as Enns said, it is a fringe view in the academe, even among scholars who actually disagree with JEDP. The sources used to build Wikipedia are academic sources, therefore JEDP and its 20-21st century offspring are given by default the weight they have inside the academia, while the view of the fundamentalists is treated according to WP:UNDUE. This does not mean that Wikipedia could say that the fundamentalists are theologically wrong (Wikipedia has no theology of its own), but it is entitled to say that inside historical scholarship they are a fringe view. Of course, this does not exclude serious scholarship done at religious faculties, since as Ehrman said in one of his bestsellers, US mainline Protestant and Catholic theological seminaries and divinity schools do teach mandatory historical criticism classes. So, in a sense, scholars from such faculties are thoroughly acquainted with historical criticism and built their careers upon its assumptions. Only fundamentalist seminaries and divinity schools choose to default against historical criticism. They are free to do this, but this cuts against their claims of being mainstream historians.",0.0

Further edits have persisted adding """"citation needed"""" tags to the lede: . Since the purpose of the lede is to summarise content in the body of the article (which should be sourced), WP:CITELEAD does require editors to add redundant citations i.e. if the claim or fact is already sourced in the article the citation does not need to be provided again in the lead. The first two sections of the article detail transcripts (in which Hitler proclaims himself to be vegetarian), diary entries and witness testimony from people very well acquainted with his diet confirming that he was almost certianly vegetarian from 1942 onwards. Sources detailing his diet prior to the war are a bit more inconsistent, indicating he may or may not have been vegetarian earlier in his life. Instead of repeatedly tagging the lead it would be helpful if the editor would at least explain their rationale for doing so; if they feel the sentence does not adequately summarise the sourced content in the article then would they please explain exactky what their problem is with it. Please note if a problem does indeed exist with the sentence, it is not that it is uncited it is that it does not neutrally and accurately summarize the claims our article makes.

(outdent) How about looking at it like this. RPG rulebooks are just that. The rulebook explains how to play the game, but it is not the game itself. The ISBN manual you reference below supports this; games """"SHALL NOT"""" be given ISBNs. There may be some confusion in the matter, but one good example is found by harking back to AD&D; 2nd Ed. To play that game required (it being rules heavy, that really is pretty much true) a minimum of two books—the DM Guide and the Players' Handbook. Neither """"contained"""" the game, and the game went far beyond what was in either. The game in all its entirety encompassed the contents of many books, magazine articles, supplements, pamphlets, online articles and what was in the head of the players. The book is about the game; it is not the game.  

For that matter, a number of the articles you tagged did not list an ISBN, so you can't really claim that you claimed it was a book in ignorance because of the ISBN. A publisher doesn't mean it's a book, as board games, computer games, and any number of things are published and have publishers.

 Question on Possible Citation 

I'm sorry if I missed your question - I don't pay much attention to that page. In response to your question, let me start by repeating my boilerplate formulation: The job of Wikipedia editors is to verifiably summarize reliable sources using the neutral point of view. (I haven't yet worked in """"no original research"""".) WP:NOR says that we mustn't integrate otherwise reliable information to arrive at novel conclusions. Comparing two lists and drawing conclusions from their differences and similarities is most likely original research. We can integrate information, so long as we don't arrive at new theories. Another principle to remember is that vagueness improves accuracy. The more precise we are the harder it is to be accurate. 

Getting down to details, the Predators and Editors website appears to be a reliable source so we can use it as a source. The Bauer site, even if somewhat unreliable, may be used in a limited fashion as a primary source about Bauer. I'm not familiar enough with this topic to make pronouncements on what would be correct. However I would say that your proposed text appears reasonable. The sources are sufficient, and no original conclusions are made. The website takedown issue is confusing to me, but you should be able to summarize what you find in reliable sources. 

Overall, my opinion is that the less we say about the subject the better. Attack articles are not encouraged. While we must show our subjects """"warts and all"""" we shouldn't enlarge the warts, nor ignore their better features. Balance is a part of NPOV. - 

""""but you should be able to summarize what you find in reliable sources."""" There no reliable sources only a he said she said blog flame war. It is alleged the website takdown was instigated by Bauer. It isn't clear if she did, and other factors between the forum and the IP are not known. It was the root cause of this article and all the players here were involved via these blogs. I don't see how that can be objective. 

 Bauer 
I'm sorry I did not get back to you about the Usenet stuff et al., but I've been somewhat overloaded at work. Personally, I think the article is better now than when I first saw it, thanks to a lot of effort on the part of the primary editors of the article to bring the best sources and present them in a way that doesn't seem like a lynch mob. Y'all are doing a good job, and there should be enough editors on either side to ensure that something resembling nuetral gets posted . I'm glad to help and try and make the article neater, and I don't mean to sound brusque in the summary field, but there was a lot to cram in there. Thanks for the note, I appreciate it!   
 I would say Karen saying I've called her names is an out and out fabrication. I've never done any such thing. 

""""or whether it's because he's been able to insult me and call me names on Wikipedia, repeatedly and without consequences""""

I've accused her and Jule of carrying the water for TNH and Absolutewrite and they have. That isn't namecalling by a long stretch. I'm really weary of these attacks over this. This is mob rule. While avi seems genuine, she's hanging with a tough insulting tribe. The threats against me are real and escalating by the hour. Blaming me won't make my points any less valid.

""":::::You resorting to dishonesty is disgusting and vile Binksternet.
For starters, dating back to the original discussion back in December 2009, while the user Optigan liked FinancialNorth1, he preferred a cropped version of the fourth photo, to which no including PaulH or you for that matter said anything as clearly noted in the discussion. As i'm saying again for the umpteenth time and as the record showed, no decision was made and the discussion ended. Paulh, or you did not say anything. If he wanted the photo then, why didn't he continue to press his case then and convince a consensus then? I would've left it at that then, but instead he and other editors remained silent. I didn't restart the discussion because I assumed that the editors simply lost interest, or didn't have the time.

Furthermore, I did not """"slip in"""" as you disgustingly, dishonestly, facetiously say. I only added that photo because I noticed for the time being that no one had made a decision since the original discussion back in January. Again, no one did anything for months. You and Paulh cannot claim you didn't see the change, because you made several other edits throughout the article for months.

Again, Paul did not form a consensus prior to the change, or continue the discussion where it had left off. Once again, he instead changed the photo, got a """"consensus"""" from Binksternet. The IP editor liked the photo, but, quoting the editor again:

""""Any of the photos in that section (""""FinancialNorth.jpg""""; """"Montgomerystreetsf.jpg""""; """"Federal Reserve Band (San Francisco).jpg"""") except #2 (SanFranciscoEmbarcadero.jpg) would be fine as a replacement, and even the cropped version of #2 is better than the one currently there now. Thoughts?64.81.57.93 (talk)""""

""""I'm going to replace it with """"FinancialNorth.jpg"""" and see what happens.""""

The crux of it was that Paulh made the change before even Binksternet approved it, or I or other editors could respond.

Binksternet's abusive little crusade against me shows my point that he and Paul have no interest in perusing collaborative editing efforts. Despite my reverts, I at least agreed to having a discussion and a """"photo choosing contest"""" as it were. Paulh did not and Binksternet is now acting as some kind of enforcing. I don't see Binksternet asking the IP editor in question or other editors to the SF article including Optigan13 have their say either in this. He is not apologizing to me and asking that we resume the discussion and consensus, something that at least Paulh did earlier. Only showing his intentions as pure slander towards me as attempt to have me banned purely because he disagrees with my edits or whatever personal victory he may get by flaming me

 Codes and """"minor"""" state 

Please stop Since there is no definition of a """"minor"""" state, there is no need to put it there. Is Algeria """"minor?"""" Iran? It's a nonsense phrase, so it should be deleted. As for making """"MA"""" a country code for Western Sahara, it's not. MA is a code for Morocco, and so it is in Morocco's infobox. EH was created for Western Sahara, so that is its country code. As far as the territory being occupied, this is a clear fact and the position of the United Nations; it is also mentioned in the article in other places. -❤T☮C☺M☯ 
It does not need a definition to be in the article. A minor state is used as opposed to super-power states, permanent members of the security council, ... etc. As to the EH domain, it clearly states the .eh tld is intended for WS but it is not assigned, """".MA"""" being the one used in the territory. The same thing applies for the currency, the MAD is the currency of Morocco, but that is also the currency you will find in use in the territory. The same thing goes for the IAC 212, the Time zone +0 UTC, etc. They are the ones used in the territory. These things have been a matter of hotted debate before and they settled on the way they have been before you started tempering with them. As to your ridiculous claim of the UN considering the territory as occupied, I already explained to you the difference between a UN position through the security council that is reiterated again and again, and a voting poll in 1979 of the Algerian-Cuban drafted document, that has no obligation on the UN. The """"Zionism=Racism"""" example is the brightest one for you to understand it. I will revert to the version that was in use before the anon IP started this mess.  
It does Since """"minor states"""" doesn't mean anything, you can't use it in this article; it's nonsense. What states that """".ma"""" is being used in the territory? Do you have any evidence of this at all? The same thing does not apply to currency, since there is no administrative body that assigns currencies to regions. To ask which currency is used in a region is different than to ask which top-level domain name has been assigned to the region; the former is defined entirely by usage, the latter is defined entirely by standards. Western Sahara is clearly occupied, as the article itself still states; I'm not going through this with you again. -❤T☮C☺M☯ 
 Ah we're back to having fun again arguing about trivialities. Minor states is indeed a value judgement - although arguably the states recognizing are largely minor on the global arena (Algeria is not a big newsmaker per se). But in the interest of neutrality, merely noting """"African, Asian, and Latin American"""" states seems reasonable. At the same time, if Koavf gets to bleat on about minor, it seems reasonable that controlled be used rather than occupied. Same standards on language. (  )
 Evidence on .ma usage would be found with sites for entities ostensibly domiciled in Western Sahara provinces using .ma. It is trivially easy to find that. Koavf's immature partisanship notwithstanding. (  )
What is an example of a website with an .ma domain name which has the server in Western Sahara? « D. Trebbien (talk) 23:40 2008 May 5 (UTC)
 Good question. Since effectively all internet service to the Western Sahara is via Maroc Telecom or other Moroccan operators, one would expect that most servers would be located in Moroccan territory (ex-WS provinces), largely in the Casa-Rabat area. Technically I am unaware of any way to determine where the physical server is actually located (versus the service). Presumably the Regional Investment Office of Laayoune (http://www.laayouneinvest.ma/fr/index.asp) may have its server physically in Laayoune. Other similar offices may also. It strikes me as useful for the article to indicate like country code, most sites use the Moroccan address (.ma). Polisario partisans may not like that, but its effective reality. (  )

""" North Korea actually gained approximately 230 km² from China in the 1962 treaty. 

And here's a 19th century book by Chong Yagyong, titled """"Korea's Northern Border Reigion"""" (in a Korean sourcebook compilation translated by Peter Hacksoo Lee): 
A long time ago, the area north of the Tumen River was the land of the Su-shen people. It has not been under our control since the time of the Three Han. The ''southern slopes of Mount Changbaek, where both the Tumen and Yalu rivers have their headwaters, lay within our territory, but the winding ridges and layers of peaks make the exact location of the border unclear. However, Emperor K'ang-hsi, in the final years of his reign [1662-1722], ordered Area Commander Wu-la (Wu-la ts'ung-kuan) Muk'eteng to delineate the border and erect a stone boundary marker. As a result, the border between those two rivers is clear as well. [emphasis mine]

Here's another study of the US-North Korea border in 1962, by the US Dept of State, which makes no mention of North Korea owning the entire mountain.  And another, which says that China actually made concessions to NK on the border in 1962 . 

The only sources that seem to claim that Korea once owned the entire place are some recent tabloid news articles that protest China conducting activities on its own side of the border, and of course, a few ultranationalist sites, but please, enlighten me if you can provide other reliable sources as well. 

On another rather amusing note, it does seem my userboxes are being quite effective experiment in showing which users are capable of  judging others by the content their edits, and which prefer to judge a book by it's cover and lash out emotionally.  
should be made in a new section on the talk page. No further edits should be made to this section. The result of the debate was no move.  ' 
Requested move
Chonji → Tianchi – The name was unilaterally moved from Tianchi to Chonji without concensus, for POV reasons (cited in move and talk page), such as that it should be Korean (it's on the border between China and Korea). Another reason cited was that the name of the Baekdu Mountain page is Korean as well. However, a Google search shows nearly 30,000 hits for Tianchi, and and less than 1,000 each for Chonji and Cheonji. That's two orders of magnitude in difference. (the preceding was quoted by Yuje)  
Survey
Add """"* Support"""" or """"* Oppose"""" followed by a brief explanation, then sign your opinion with ~~~~
 Support for the most common name. Searches for """"Chonji"""" for all the most popular search engines combined give less than a thousand hits. Search on Google scholar shows only 2 uses of the name """"Chonji"""" for the lake. The use of Chonji as a clear common name doesn't apply because it's not common. 
 Support — per Yuje.  Naming conventions gives preference to the more popular name. 
Oppose per Visviva and my previous comments. Like I said before, we need to use the most common name that is the clearest because """"Tianchi"""" is a name for many other places in China.  
As shown, Chonji is nowhere near common. Chonji barely shows up any hits, therefore isn't a viable alternative for a clear alternative name.  
Oppose Look at my reason below.  
Comment:  The proposition seems to be flawed...  Given that Tianchi is now an article on the lake in Urumqi, if this article is moved it would need to go somewhere else; perhaps Tianchi (Changbaishan) or even (heh heh) Tianchi (Paektusan), but then again maybe Tianchi (Jilin)... if we must'' have a straw poll, it would be helpful to know what the full suggested title is.    Comment''': The issue you brought up is a legitimate one and shouldn't be ignored. Thus perhaps Tianchi could be a disambiguation page, or this page could be moved back to the original and there could be a Tianchi (disambiguation) page. Either one is a reasonable alterna",0.0

""":It is neither more historically correct, nor more professional. Scholars routinely use the term """"Nazi"""". You cite the Encyclopedia Britannia as evidence of your claim. But, in fact, the Encyclopedia Britanica uses Nazi an order of magnitude more often than National Socialism. In the online version of the Encyclopedia, there are 10,200 references to Nazi and only 1020 references to """"National Socialism"""". And in the title of the entry for """"National Socialism"""", they write """"also called Nazism or Naziism"""". 

Your claim that use of the term """"Nazi"""" is amateurish is a slur on the overwhelming majority of scholars who routinely use the term. The claim that """"National Socialism"""" is a """"more full and correct designation"""" is inconsistent with the fact that the two phrases are synonymous. And while it is true that """"Nazi"""" can be used as an epithet, so can """"dog"""". Do you also recommend that Wikipedia refrain from using the word """"dog"""" to describe dogs? 

It is interesting that you use Linder as support for your argument. The particular passage that you link to is an explanation by Linder as to why he will use the term """"Nazi"""" rather than """"National Socialist"""" throughout his book. I fail to see why this is evidence that Wikipedia should do the opposite.

I am curious about your statement that use of the term Nazi arises from a deeper intent by political opponents to give a skewed view of their politics. What part of Nazi politics do you feel has been skewed by their political opponents?

Parts of my own Talk Page deleted by editors who think they know better

Dear impartial but not disinteresed reader, Coren and I have been having an entertaining and enjoyable """"discussion"""" on the finer points of """"soapboxing"""".  She is of the firm, resolute belief that this version of my own talk page amounts to """"soapboxing"""" and has deleted it.  I recognize that there may be elements of soapboxing in the """"investment predictions for 2008"""" section at the bottom of the page, but have given her the opportunity to amend rather than delete the whole section.  She has declined the opportunity to amend, leaving me in the difficult position of having to type this with a knife pressed ever-so-gently against my back, with Coren carefully looking over my shoulder at the screen to check whether anything is, in her God-like view, """"soap-like"""".  Not the most pleasant position to be in, I can assure you.

To use another example, picked completely at random: Let's say there's been a nasty and vicious and ugly and persistent edit war over, say, fractional reserve banking, and a number of editors want a messy but more informative version like this one kept in.  Then let's say I post this earlier version on my talk page for readers to compare with the now in-my-humble-view slaughtered version.  Is that """"soapboxing""""??

To use another example, closer to home.  Let's say a guy like Zenwhat says to his co-conspirators, """"What can we do to have OUR version of debt-based monetary system/fractional reserve banking prevail?"""", like he clearly said here under the (desperate?) heading """"Heeeeelp"""".  

And then he also (bizarrely?) asks Gregalton help him delete references to Mises.org like he did here, saying to Gregalton: """"Also, in case you're interested, one of the easiest ways to find economics articles that have been vandalized is to do a search for links to Mises.org""""

As if a reference to the great Ludwig von Mises amounted to VANDALISM? Can you BELIEVE IT?  I have to hold a pencil between my teeth just to keep control of myself and keep typing this.  The guy is clearly a vicious tiny weeny little troll.  

He also says to his co-conspirator the following, on the same page: 

""""I looked at the fractional reserve banking article recently and saw how it was so horribly vandalized. It made me realize that we're going around in circles. We improve the articles to the point that they look great. Then they get screwed up again. So, I had an idea: Would you be interested in helping me write an essay on """"Monetary Crankery""""? It could help people who AREN'T educated...The idea is for it to be straightforward, with references, but polemic and satirical of monetary crankery.""""

Clearly this guy is obsessed with deleting or """"satirizing"""" any positions on monetary theory that don't agree with his.  (The guy is mad.  If the guy had napalm or nukes he'd use them without hesitation.)   

Then, for good measure, he goes back to debt-based monetary system to do more """"editing"""".  

Zenwhat is clearly a piece of work.  Check out the dude's talk page.  In addition to his obsessive interest in deleting anything associated with Mises.org, his main interests appear to be something called """"cannabis culture"""" and """"the Buddhist connection with marijuana"""".  So, I gather from this that his main """"interests"""" are monetary theory and dope smoking.  What a combo!

Seeing this, I ponder my options.  I decide to post a note here, ON MY OWN TALK PAGE, asking readers to compare older (better?) versions of some important articles on monetary theory with the current versions.  For good measure I offer my predictions on the financial markets for 2008 as a gift to the (eight?) people persistent enough to read my humble little talk page.  

It immediately gets deleted by all-seeing, all-knowing Coren as """"soapboxing"""".  Is this strict compliance with WP guidelines or a WP-style Fascist Dictatorship where people like Coren delete at will, but don't bother to make CONSTRUCTIVE suggestions as to how what I have written CAN come within the guidelines?    

This is like watching evolution in reverse.  I carefully construct a page with the help of others.

 Trying to measure the number of cafes

 Solstice
 Cafe Zoe
 The original Allegro (on an alley parallel to the Ave); arguably, its second location in the College Inn also counts
 The Ugly Mug (half block off)
 The Cafe at the corner of 42nd that used to be the Roma, but I can't recall its new name

 Tully's 
 Starbucks
 Wannabee (one block off)
 Still Life on the Ave (at the Grand Illusion); technically, the entrance is around the corner, but it is clearly effectively on the Ave.

YOUR SERIOUS MENTAL ILLNESS AND ADDICTION

This is the most """"contructive"""" thing that can ever be contributed as it relates to you and your involvement here: Please stop and think about the depth of your sickness, sitting there, with your face glued to your computer screen, uncompensated day after day, week after week, for YEARS, tinkering with the biographies of people you don't even know, who actually are out living real lives while you are imprisoned by your addiction.  You have literally wasted years of your life with this lonely, self-destructive addiction and illness, which has been at the expense of living your own life.  The depth of your mental illness must make it difficult for you to see the extraordinary insanity of your actions and how your addiction has stripped you of the life that was given you.  

I know a few others have evaluated what you do here and laugh at you and your sickness.  It's something of an inside joke, and I guess few share it with you because they consider you hopeless.  That's not right either, and I'd ask them to please stop that and try to help you.  Don't laugh at this person behind their back and then just communicate with them on routine matters.  That lacks all caring for a person who has an obvious and very serious illness. Something is very wrong with him/her, and while it may not be for us to diagnose the exact problem, we should pause to help with advice.  Please share with him/her what we all know.  It's only humane to do so. 

I will do so now too:

Jerzy (or whatever your name isconsciously concealed, I'm sure, to keep your illness as private as possible), please consider some uncomfortable facts:  Years of your life have now been totally consumed and absolutely wasted by your deep, deep sickness and obvious addiction.  Please don't make excuses for yourself.  You cannot go on like this any longer.  You need to stop, and you need to stop today.  Reject this advice, and I worry that your sickness will probably only deepen and your addiction will waste whatever is left of your life.  Please stop.  It's over.  Enough.  Move on.  I do wish you the best and hope you will take this friendly advice seriously.  It will be the first and last time I share it, and I hope you know that I share it only with your best interests in mind.  It's sad what has happened to you, but I wish you good luck and hope this advice is helpful.  But please take itand do so today.  You cannot go on like this.""",0.0

 Borders: It's close enough but I wish it's possible to use increasingly lighter shades. E.g., You've followed the present-day border, more or less, for the Chinese border, which I suppose is a reasonable representation of the """"line of control"""". But the reality was that there was a huge overlap across the line. Anaukpetlun and Thalun controlled some of Koshanpye (1622-1626 campaigns) on top of present-day Shan State and east of Bhamo (though not as extensive or deeper into Yunnan as did Bayinnaung); likewise, all the sawbwas in modern Kachin State and sawbwas in northern Shan State also paid dual tribute. But since it's not technically feasible, I guess we'll just have to provide an explanation on this.
 A number of locations are offsome by a lot. Chiang Mai, Ava, Kyaukse, Nyangshwe, Pegu and Kale.
 Also please add the cities of Nan and Chaing Saen in Lan Na. Nan was the easternmost possession. Chaing Saen (Kyaing Thin) was the capital of northern Lan Na. (The Burmese divided Lan Na into two.)

At the moment you are giving prominence to a one country study in a controversial area that is itself 8 years old.

Hello again, Tdadamemd. Getting right to your comment about slang, I don't understand your stating that """"fuck"""" is not slang, or your linking to dictionary.com as proof that it is not. The word """"fuck,"""" while vulgar, is also slang; the dictionary.com source you cited even states so. It makes it clear that it can be slang for a variety of things, including sexual intercourse/other sexual activity. It list 13 numbered examples regarding what """"fuck"""" can mean. As for Wiktionary, I don't refer to sources like that. And, yes, I am fine with mentioning """"fuck"""" (or """"fucking"""") and the euphemism """"sleeping together"""" lower in the article, in the the Definitions and stimulation factors section, as alternative words for sexual intercourse/sexual activity. But again, there are a lot of terms for sexual intercourse, most of them slang. That these terms exist doesn't mean that all of them should be in this article. In fact, most times when there are many alternative terms for a word, especially if those terms are slang, we don't include all of them. As you know, this is an encyclopedia and not a dictionary. 

If WP:CONSENSUS is achieved for including your proposal, I'll add it by briefly summarizing that there are various vulgar and/or slang terms and euphemisms for sexual intercourse/other sexual activity...such as """"fuck"""" and """"sleeping together"""" (the wording won't be exactly like that, of course). And, really, because there are so many terms for sexual intercourse, and """"fuck"""" is not especially relevant to the topic of sexual intercourse (by that, I mean that most people and sources are not discussing the word """"fuck"""" when discussing sexual intercourse), that is probably why """"fuck"""" isn't currently in this article. Someone who is aware of your having repeatedly added it to the lead expressed to me via email me that """"fuck"""" is also U.S.-centric; so that's also something to think about, though the term is also used outside of the United States. 

Also, sexual intercourse does not = fuck. It's that fuck = sexual intercourse; in its literal sense anyway, since when people use the term...they are usually using it as profanity. That is also why I told you """"The Fuck article mentions sexual intercourse in its lead because it is especially relevant to the topic. However, the term 'fuck' is not especially relevant to the topic of sexual intercourse."""" 

I cannot see how this article is broken simply because it doesn't currently include """"fuck."""" But, like I stated, I don't mind adding it to the article. I'd rather see what others have to state on that matter first, however.   """,1.0

 Can someone explain criticism #6 to me? 

This is taken from the criticisms section of the article:

6. Since logic is inherently constant, and that some things are more true than others, it means that """"strong"""" relativism cannot hold true under many conditions. Relativism often ignores how views have different weight to another. An example of a similar phenomenon is the Gay Marriage debate in the U.S. - an example where the majority dictates the rights of the entirety even when it doesn't apply to them, as they do not weigh up the effects of their views. 

Can someone explain what exactly this means? 
I do not follow the first half of the paragraph (the one that actually pertains to relativism), and the example reads as complete nonsense to me, especially this part:

""""...the majority dictates the rights of the entirety even when it doesn't apply to them, as they do not weigh up the effects of their views.""""

I do not think that:
a) The majority in question believes that """"it"""" doesn't apply to them. (Though I'm not sure what """"it"""" is in this context, so the sentence may be true.) The majority believes that allowing gay marriage would undermine the moral standards of their society, which, of course, applies to everybody in that society.
b) The majority in question does not """"weigh up the effects of its views"""". Its views are that gay marriage should not be allowed, for the benefit of society; it is aware of the effects; and does not object to them.  """,0.0

It seems that either you do not understand, either you are of bad faith. Let's make it simple:

According to Encyclopaedia Judaica (Jerusalem, 1972), not I, the great argument of the Reform rabbis in Frankfurt (1843) was """"God ordered circumcision to Abraham, not to Moses""""; in other words God's COMMANDMENT to Abraham is circumcision, God's COMMANDMENTS to Moses do not order circumcision; in other words:

- God's One Commandment to Abraham = circumcision.

- God's Ten Commandments to Moses = not even one for circumcision!

The rabbis, not I said so! Therefore, wholly and seriously documented, I wrote it into the main article but WP and S rub it out. This is an insane violation of the wiki rules.

Now, in order to enlighten the main article, the 2nd Commandment topic of this """"Discussion""""  introduces my """"discovery"""" (a child would do it). It says:

- God's 2nd Commandment to Moses orders him: """"Do not circumcise.""""

But, contrary to the saying of PW and S, I never attributed this to the Reform rabbis.

Conclusion: who forgot to take their medicine, for several days now? Not I!

The ethical question involved about this discussion is: """"How can the wiki support a very obviously childish lie just because this lie has been carried along for millennia?"""" Think about it! If you are responsible persons, you cannot publish an obvious lie without warning your readers, which I am doing.

Sigi's request to WP and S: """"Circumcise your heart, eyes, ears and pen, not your peco!"""" because yes, this criminal violation of Moses 2nd Commandment is being done every day in the USA to baby boys. It even has been done to an Oregon girl, in 1950 (see http://www.aesculapiuspress.com/ - Books – The rape of innocence); indeed a good American mother cannot want her beloved daughter be deprived from circumcision when her beloved son gets it, can she?

 The Band's legacy, Beggar's Banquet, etc. 

An anonymous user is repeatedly misreading The Guardian source and insisting on adding a dubious tag to it.  Here's the direct quote:

The spark for Fairport taking this watershed turn was the Band's 1968 album Music from Big Pink, the record that - along with Bob Dylan and the Band's Basement Tapes bootleg - brought about a widespread musical volte-face, in which what remained of psychedelia was replaced by a new rootsiness. Among the rock aristocracy, its influence was evident in the Beatles' ill-fated back-to-basics project Let It Be, the Rolling Stones' purple patch that began with Beggars Banquet, and Eric Clapton's decision to call time on Cream.

The anonymous user takes issue with this statement, claiming that Music from Big Pink could not have influenced Beggar's Banquet because of chronology, i.e., that the Stones were almost done recording the album when Big Pink came out.  But, read the statement: it does not say that it influenced the recording of Banquet, but the """"purple patch that began with...,"""" etc.  This seems clear to me.

If anything, nonviolent protests weaken the resolve of the Muslim brotherhood, making them less of an influence in the everyday life of Syrians.

Hagee gets a couple paragraphs in that article.  The relationship (if one can call it that) between Hagee and McCain was much more remote and brief than that between Obama and Wright.  Many elections nowadays feature guilt-by-association games, but Obama-Wright-TUCC is a bit different, because the coverage went on so long during the campaign, and the relationship went on so long in real life.  If Hagee turns out to bedevil McCain as much as Wright and TUCC has affected Obama, it would merit inclusion here in this main McCain article.  There are hundreds of other items in the sub-articles also. Picking out just Hagee to add to this main article, and not picking out those other hundreds of items, would cause undue weight. This article is about McCain's whole life, not just the current campaign, and in the context of his whole life Hagee is just not very significant. If a person is scratching their head wondering the name of some minister connected with this election, then the person can go to the article about McCain's 2008 campaign (which has a couple paragraphs about Hagee). In writing this article, dozens of decisions were made about what the most important things in his life are, and those that aren't quite as important don't make the cut.  Right now, some of us think it would be more appropriate to add more about his Vietnam service before the shoot-down, or more on McCain-Feingold, or more on his relations with the Republican Party in the early 2000s, as compared to more about Hagee.",0.0

 The Truth about the 1986 Sinn Féin Ard Fheis 

The story of how Gerry Adams tried to turn an eighty year old revolutionary movement into a British Constitutional party.  How he broke the Sinn Féin constitution, created fake cumainn to give him fake votes and barred life long republicans from voting.  How he managed to expel himself and his supporters from Sinn Féin membership.  And, how a small band of republicans managed to keep the Sinn Féin constitution and traditional policy in tact. 

In 1986 Section 1b. of the Sinn Féin constitution read as follows:

“No person who is a member of any political party organisation or who approves of or supports the candidature of persons who, if elected, intend taking part in the proceedings of the Westminster or partitionist 26-County or 6-County  parliaments or who approves of or supports the candidature of persons who sign any form or give any kind of written or verbal undertaking of intention to take their seats in these institutions, shall be admitted to membership or allowed to retain membership."""" 

The Adams leadership put forward a motion, titled Resolution 162, at the 1986 Ard Fheis.  Its wording was as follows: 

RESOLUTION 162

THAT this Ard-Fheis drops its abstentionist attitude to Leinster House. Successful Sinn Fein parliamentary candidates in 26-County elections:

a. Shall attend Leinster House as directed by the Ard Chomhairle.

b. Shall not draw their salaries for personal use. (Parliamentary representatives shall be paid a Sinn Fein organiser’s subsidy, and the Leinster House salary shall be divided at the direction of the Ard Chomhairle to defray national and constituency expenses.)

To accommodate this change, the Constitution and Rules be amended as follows:

That Section 1b of the Constitution be amended to read:
 
No person who is a member of any political party organisation or who approves of or supports the candidature of persons who, if elected, intend taking part in the proceedings of the Westminster or partitionist 6-County parliaments or who approves of or supports the candidature of persons who sign any form or give any kind of written or verbal undertaking of intention to take their seats in these institutions, shall be admitted to membership or allowed to retain membership. 

Motion 162 supports and approves of the candidature of persons who, if  elected, would be of the intention to take their seats in certain circumstances i.e. on the direction of the Ard Chomhairle.  Obviously, Motion 162 infringes Section 1b.  Section 1b. was in effect at the time this Resolution was presented.  Its clear that Adams made a mistake in procedure.  He should have sought a majority decision to amend Section 1b. in 1986 and returned in 1987 to propose entering Leinster House.  Trying to amend Section 1b. and propose taking seats in the “partitionist 26-County Parliament” in the same Resolution was a logical impossibility. 

Can anybody say that  the wording:

“That this Ard-Fheis drops its abstentionist attitude to Leinster House. Successful Sinn Fein parliamentary candidates in 26-County elections:

a.  Shall attend Leinster House as directed by the Ard Chomhairle”

does not constitute the supporting and approving of the candidature of persons who intend to take their seats in Leinster House as directed by the Ard Chomhairle?
Clearly Adams was in breach of Section 1b. and according to that section he had expelled himself, and all those who voted for Resolution 162.

Brian Feeney, in his book, Sinn Féin 100 Turbulent Years, puts forward the argument that Adams had managed to bypass Section 1b, by introducing a motion in 1983 allowing the “discussion” of any aspect of the Sinn Féin constitution.  This change may indeed have facilitated debate on abstentionism but it did not infringe on the content or effect of Section 1b in any way.  To discuss something is not the same as formally proposing or supporting it.  For example, conventions are held regularly where drug addiction is discussed without any of the delegates proposing or supporting it.  In fact the line Adams added in 1983 was superfluous, as the Sinn Féin constitution had never banned the “discussion” of anything – just the “approving” and “supporting” of taking seats in named partitionist parliaments.

Of course its not illegal to amend or remove section 1b. Section 1b. bans the approval or support of candidates who intend to take seats in British assemblies. It can be removed or amended at any Ard Fheis by a two thirds majority. The reason for doing so could be many. Perhaps delegates might feel that it implies that they cannot be trusted to be loyal to the Republic. In fact its not necessary, according to the constitution, to give any reason. But you",0.0

Although I understand your arguments, I am surprised you don't understand mine.  I don't find it labyrinthine, or at least not particularly so.  (Not more than many other events and aspects concerning the Beatles.)  Nor is the interpretation in question in any way obscure, since it can be taken from any number of texts on the Beatles.  However, though I support the original author's intent here, I guess you and I are going to have to agree to disagree over this point for now.  At some point, however, I will source his/her statements  as soon as I find time to delve into the texts  just because I would appreciate reaching some sort of accord with you.  Until then, I don't think we will make much more progress on this.
 

[The problem with something like this is that there is no absolute truth.  But to me, discrediting the original author's intent is like a dog biting its own tail.  From wikipedia: re. Abbey Road being the final album or not:Abbey Road is the eleventh official album recorded by The Beatles. Although its release preceded that of Let It Be, it was the last album to be recorded. 
...
After the near-disastrous sessions for the proposed Get Back album (later retitled Let It Be for release), Paul McCartney suggested to producer George Martin that the group get together and make an album """"just like the old days. .. just like we used to,"""" free of the conflict that began with the sessions for The White Album. Martin agreed to this if the band would be """"the way they used to be."""" In their interviews for the Beatles Anthology series, the surviving band members stated they knew at the time this would very likely be the final Beatles' product, and therefore they agreed to set aside their differences and """"go out on a high note.""""re. the position of """"The End"""":""""The End"""" was initially intended to be the final track on Abbey Road, but it is followed by """"Her Majesty"""". In the first practice mix of the medley, constructed on 30 July, """"Her Majesty"""" followed """"Mean Mr. Mustard""""...

...etc.  This labyrinth has already been walked through a thousand times by a thousand people.]

The vote was on the Campbell Case but the primary reason was the Russian Treaties:

""""Baldwin was careful to emphasise that the Treaties were the substance of his objections. Standfordham wrote to the King, on 7 October, 'I saw Mr Baldwin who, in reply to my question """"Do you want to turn the Government out?"""" said """"Yes, but not on the Campbell issue, but on the Russian Treaties which the country generally condemns."""" He sees no alternative to a dissolution; it has always been expected, some wished for it before now, though he is opposed to hastening the Government's fall. ...' ... And it is true that only in the House of Commons were Baldwin's strictures based on the Campbell case – at Newcastle on 2 October he congratulated MacDonald on the agreement, achieved at a conference in London, on the Dawes Plan for reparations, and then spent the rest of the speech alternately pouring scorn on the Labour party's subservience to its extremists, and tearing to pieces the Russian agreement. But the final debate on 8 October was a mean Parliamentary occasion. Two days before, in a meeting which was something of a suave qui puet, the Cabinet decided to take it as a vote of confidence, preferring to go out on the Campbell case to a defeat on the Russian Treaties which might give the left wing too much prominence.—Middlemas and Barnes, p. 273.

This article is ludicrous, it paints anti-religonists with some kind of generalizing brush that Atheists have been getting away with for decades now. That is, that *we* can refer to ourselves in the 3rd person and apply any positive adjective we wish. I.e. O'Hare and other Atheists claiming """"Atheists would rather do X than Y.""""

 Template:Infobox Network 

Hi. I've restored your version of the code for the template header, so that it appears within the infoboxas is standardrather than above it. This, and adding a couple optional info lines, has brought me to the limits of my coding ability. Request: Is it possible to further modify the code, so an editor has the option of employing the infobox without using a header at all? (See, for example, the use of Infobox Biography in Henry Cowell.) When I attempt this with Infobox Network (that is, either erasing the """"name"""" line or leaving it blank, under any of the recent iterations of the header code), it leaves a little rogue vertical mark in the linespace above the logo image, insteading of eliminating the linespace altogether. (Test, for example, in Mutual Broadcasting System, the article I'm currently working on.) Thanks very much. Best, Dan—

"""

I've got to say, I've read you """"pacafistic"""" rules, seen your idea of """"logic"""", and have heard tales of your """"justification"""" and I just have to say:

I have this to say on my behavior:
I'm a perfectly reasonable person when it comes to arguements, even when they are against my favor. I change subjects, help the people with simple little details they might have gotten wrong, ask them for proper information that I might use against them, basically anything a scatter brainer would do.

I let people have their ways for a little while just to experiment with how it turns out, I try to help BOTH OF US come out on top, I treat both equelly, and I don't get angry when someone yells in my face.

Why should I? They are angry first so I know they are suffering enough and would only poke at them some more just to annoy them (sound fimiliar?) I give them their space though I would still do what I did/do to annoy them. Except, I do it without coming into contact with them (as they would do to me) which I know we'd both appreciate.

I keep the sitch isolated someone else doesn'tblow the entire thing out of proportion before me and that person can resolve the matter only with each other which is inevitable. Others can't resolve the problem, only make it bigger and more serious for either 1 or both. see below.

If they ever try to apologize I tell them not to→ because I wouldn't→ because I have no reason to→ because we shouldn't have been in a scrabble no if ands or buts about it. Conflict is stupid. Almost (but not quite) as stupid as the species that create/embrace it. Leave the creatures space to realize this and you will have peace once more until the next pointless bicker and inevitable resolve.

Now, I have this to say about the """"good"""" people of wikipedia:
Wow.
There sure aren't a lot of you. I wonder why... You've seen many cases and classes of human behavior and traits, you (think) you know what to expect. Well you have most of it down. But you went wrong at a few turns:
1. You (blindly) follow invalid rules and principles that completely misinterpret the act and are constantly showing how much shit they're full of.

2. You think you got """"human psychology"""" in the bag and have tried to play from this to class your principles into rules but your system is far outdated and very inhumane.

3. You don't want to and try not to link yourselves and articles with POV(point of views) but little have you realized your entire system thrives apon it. 
You take sides in arguments between users based solely on what YOU think is most right based apon how YOU have been taught what is right. You are NO ONE to interpret what """"mad"""", """"kind"""", """"eccentric"""", ect. is. Just another group of the bunch and they all think seperately on subjects or else we'd look and be exactly the same. And you don't want that. 
And don't you tell me to calm down, I get just the opposite when people try to make me look crazy that way, and it certainly isn't any diffen't with Bots. 

4. Most importantly, you robots are full of shit:
You take leaders/favorites→ who take favorites→ who put up with your shit like its the right thing to do because they don't knowwhat else to do. Sickening.

2a. You abuse your power instead of embracing it's enlightenment.
Don't you get it?! He wasn't going to block me himself because he wanted to toy with me. He knew I knew he was higher than me and could just as easily waved a hand and blocked me himself. But he didn't. He wanted to add insult to injury. 
You think people want to have someone powerful to look up to? NO! They want to be someone powerful so they can feel embraced/in. 
We all want what we shouldn't have. 
Unfortunately, there are some of us who already have what we shouldn't have.

5. How you go about it is the wrong way. 
Some things people must learn for themselves. You have a problem, try relying on yourself and no one else to resolve.  
If some people are fighting with each other over the internet just sit back and let them/butt out and leave them to their bickering. Sooner or later they will stop arguing of their own account/or reasoning. Or they may even just """"stop"""". BUT if someone bigger than both of them butts in and takes a side however they see fit, things will get much worse.

Your email to me requesting your IP address be unblocked failed to instill any trust. You claim to be one person (Lawrence), yet you send me email from an address that clearly belongs to another (Ramirez)? Are all accounts at your organization as compromised as your Wikipedia account has been?

You state """"It is not possible for me to set up another account on another IP address because this is my IP address."""" No, it is not your IP address. It belongs to your organization.

This page is constatntly written to with opinions and non factual rubbish, which simply need changing and then leaving alone.

The article needs protecting and only updateable by official christian death facts.  People that want information about any past members will have to have pages dedicated to them.  But the article should be adhered to as much as facts allow.  3rd party discussion regarding Valor or Rozz should be eliminated in favour of the Christian Death Biography.

CHRISTIAN DEATH

BIOGRAPHY
&
Discography  

In the beginning God created the Heaven and the Earth. Then Christian Death turned it upside down.

History
Officially there have been over 30 musicians involved with the band. Therefore a historical litany of them all would be impractical.

Formed in Los Angeles and fronted by 16 year old vocalist/lyricist Rozz Williams, the band released the first album “Only Theatre Of Pain in 1982. A dark, sinister style of punk rock. The album gained local success. A year later the band completely broke up

Singer Rozz then joined the band “Pompeii 99' founded by singer, guitarist, song writer Valor.
Rozz took over vocals leaving Valor to focus on guitar. Before Rozz joined Pompeii 99, the band had already released their fist album “Look At Yourself” to much acclaim, which had an apocalyptic theme with a punk rock flavor. The Pompeii 99 had been planning their first tour when it was proposed by their French record company, to merge Pompeii 99 into a new version of Christian Death which after some debate was agreed upon. Thus, began the new Christian Death and the first Pompeii 99 tour became the first Christian Death tour.

Part way through the tour the band stopped in Wales to record songs, some of which were originally intended for the next Pompeii 99 album. The fusion of which led to the unique sound of the classic “Catastrophe   Ballet”.
Like the first Pompeii 99 album, Catastrophe Ballet had an apocalyptic theme, however the music morphed into something not quite Pompeii 99 and nothing like the first Christian Death album. After the tour the band returned to LA to later record the 3rd Christian Death album”Ashes”which was a post apocalyptic vision of a cold and bleak future. 

After confirming the 2nd tour in 85 singer Rozz quit the band. Valor returned to vocals, the band embarked on the 2nd tour. In Italy the band recorded the mini album “The Wind Kissed Pictures”, a surrealist view of a mystical past. Almost immediately work began on the 4th full length album “Atrocities” inspired by the atrocities of World War II and the connection to future shock waves. While continuously touring in 87 the band released the 5th and now classic album “The Scriptures”, the theme of which explored world religion and how the legacy of these beliefs impact our world today.

1988 Brought us the release of “Sex & Drugs & Jesus Christ”. This was turning point for the band. The cover depicted an image of Jesus shooting up heroin. This was a full frontal attack by Valor against the Church with a scathing heretical mockery of organized Christianity. The band then found themselves confronted by protesters, riots and bomb threats, These events and the bands imagery and fashion went on to influence the likes of Nine Inch Nails, Korn, Marilyn Manson, Type O Negative, every Goth band on the planet and many others.

1989 saw the release of the double album epic “All the Love, All the Hate” interpreting the juxtaposition between life and death, day and night, man and woman, black and white.

In 1991 came the release of “Insanus, Ultio, proditio, Misericordiaque”, with its theme of an ancient dream state.

Late in 91, after being in several other bands and seven years after quitting Christian Death, Rozz was persuaded by unscrupulous profiteers to perform at a concert in Los Angels under the name Christian Death. On the same day Christian Death was in Europe performing in Paris, France. Assuming this was a one time effort to earn extra cash, as explained to Valor",0.0

"""Changes to this Page - Open discussion ==
Since my first contribution over two months ago, I have been trying my best to make known my views on what improvements could be made to this page. After an initial consultation with an administrator I decided to """"be bold"""" and start a """"démenagement"""" of all that had nothing to do with the city of Paris. I was met with opposition over a link - and after being complained about I thought it best to put things back the way they were until I could get a good feel of the """"general concensus"""" of the page's contibutors. I have seen little concensus but a lot of silent stalling.

My goal here is not to """"control"""" anything, as was complained to one of the administrators - I would like only to contribute to making a better page. I have learned much from other Paris pages and pages concerning French history - namely those concerning the French kings - but those are well covered as far as knowledgable contributors are concerned and are in little need of improvement, so I had little to do there. This page, on the other hand, I find lacking, and see many things that could be improved.

The most important fault this page has is its quantity of specialised information - far too much for a general """"Paris"""" page. The search function is a very important element of Wikipedia, and with this in mind, much on this page is redundant and unneccessary. Those looking for """"Paris economy"""" will type exactly that into the search window. The same for """"Paris history"""" or """"paris fashion"""". Here I am but repeating what I have already written below.

In short, in order to make this page a comprehensible tool for one looking for a lead from the subject of Paris, or one totally ignorant on the subject  - in other words, one who knows only enough to type only """"Paris"""" into the search window - I propose to move the more """"specialty"""" information to their own pages. My apologies to those who have contributed the more detailed information, but this would be better suited to a """"specialty"""" page of its own. This would even be a positive move, as it would allow the contributor knowledgable in the subject of his contribution to expand his input far beyond what could be contained on this one page.

The irony of the sort is that, though I contribute to Wiki, it won't be to this page in any quantity. My specialty is the history of Paris, and I cannot even think to add that knowledge here - Paris' history has a page of its own. Just to give you all a clear idea of where my aims are.

Here I would like to contribute in the interest of clear information. I hope with this post to create an opportunity for improvement - please answer with any ideas you would have. With this post I would also like to """"sound the board"""" - to see whether it is an interest for information or partisanship that holds the upper hand on this page, as what I have seen to date leaves room for doubt. In your answers, I hope for evidence to the contrary. 

Please feel free to forward any thoughts on the matter at all.

 

ADDENDUM

 You can find a proposition for restructuring here ->  - please keep in mind that this is only a structure reference marked only by short notes, I don't really want to cut everthing out!

Hello Deacon, thanks for the kind words. Your wording is better regarding territory, but I think that it still might specifically mention the Firth of Clyde, since Northumbria ruled the area south of it for a while ... how about """"between the Humber and the Firths of Clyde and Forth"""", or similar? But there's no great preference here either way.

Oswiu chose the Roman way at Whitby in 664, and he died in 670; thereafter there was a steady erosion of Iona-based clerics in Northumbrian territory, quite noticeable by Pehthelm's consecration in the 8th century ... have a look at the Skene reference I cite, which suggests that both Picts and Northumbrians were working in concert in the early 8th century towards the Roman way in preference to the Columban way.

It looks like a political process, constant and steady, but not a sudden, forcible ouster ... the end result was indeed a facilitation of Northumbrian hegemony. Northumbria's fortunes were up-and-down in the 7th century regarding its southern neighbors, particularly Mercia, and that is not to suggest that anyone chose Deiran preferences over Bernician ones. I'm aware of the substantial history of Iona-based clerics in Bernicia, but times change (and sometimes political entities do things for expedient reasons).

"""::Seems like implying that someone who has different polices is opposed to BSA is a collolary to the principle shoved at me when I tried to include rpoportionality numbers.  Here's the quote:

Let me give this an example, let's say I'm talking about the 2004 US Presidential Election. Suppose I say this:

""""Only 60 million Americans (out of the 300 million Americans total) voted to re-elect President Bush."""" 
This sentence is technically true, and it is technically factual, but it is also misleading and unfair to President Bush. The sentence implies that while only 60 million supported the President, the other 240 million didn't vote for him. This is technically true, but it's totally unfair and misleading. The fact is, most American's don't vote, and the majority of those 300 million were """"undecided"""", not """"opposed to Bush"""". And as we know, Bush was, in fact, the most popular candidate. So to say """"60 million out of 300 million total supported Bush"""" is simply very, very misleading even if every word of it happens to be true.

So saying others with different policies are opposed to BSAis the same kind inferrence some were vehemently against.  ;-)

Here are some other hints and tips:

 I would recommend that you get a username.  You don't have to log in to read or edit articles on Wikipedia, but creating an account is quick, free and non-intrusive, requires no personal information, and there are many benefits of having a username.  (If you edit without a username, your IP address is used to identify you instead.)
 When using talk pages, please sign your name at the end of your messages by typing four tildes (~~~~). This will automatically produce your username (or IP address) and the date.

If you have any questions, check out Wikipedia:Where to ask a question, ask me on , or type  {{helpme}}  on this talk page and a user will help you as soon as possible. I will answer your questions as far as I can.  Again, welcome, and I hope you enjoy editing here and being a Wikipedian.",0.0

no seriousy.  the only thing i think actually did or said against your precious wikipedia policies was saying that """"if i really had my way, half of you would be shot"""".  ignoring for a while the fact that i was obviously joking, it happens to be my religious belief that the human race on a whole would be much, much better off if 95% of the population died tomorrow.  that doesn't mean i go around killing people, or making specific death threats against individuals.  and don't you actually have the sense to realize that if someone says """"OH MY GOD YOU ARE SUCH A FUCKING IDIOT, JUST GO DIE ALREADY"""" that they probably don't want you to die, or more accurately they don't care.  Very few people actually have the emotion required to sit and pray for the death of another person or group of people.  And I am not one of those people.

If you really wanted to show off what a horrible and insensitive person I am,  edit, which was on a wiki talk page, is probably not the best.  Granted, nothing pisses me off more than people who see letters like я and щ and automatically assume that whatever is written is Russian.  The Cyrillic alphabet is used in many Slavic languages, as well as central asian former soviet republics, and even Mongolia.  So I called someone an idiot.  BOO FUCKING HOO.  maybe he could have said """"What language is that?"""" instead of assuming that it was Russian.  However insulted he was by me calling him an idiot, I can guarantee you that I was at least 10 times as insulted by him calling that Russian.  I am a proud, native Russian, and will not have my culture besmirched with these allegations.

Your other example how I am a bad contributor is what, a spelling correction?  Or was it the fact that my edit summary was how I felt about the sad fact that niggers can't spell? Don't even think about raising issue of my use of the word.  I live in Harlem.  Around here, that word is used like a comma.  And before you try to tell me the difference between """"nigga"""" and """"nigger"""", there is none.  It's called a dialect.  While for some purposes, it makes sense to write things phonetically as they are pronounced by the person saying them, I find it is usually clearer to spell properly.  Also, a nigger, to me at least, is not a """"black person"""". I am not a racist. I do not even draw distinctions between people. In my holy opinion, there is a nigger inside of all of us.  People (like you, for instance) who take offense for no reason (i mean, was saying """"black people are stupid and i think they should be marginalized in society, tarred and feathered, strung up on trees, dragged through town by their enormous wangs, etc.""""?  No.  And if that is what you heard, I'd like to know why.  Are you black?  98% of the black people I know personally use the word """"nigger"""" more than I do.) are why we as a society still can't get over the silly idea that words are harmful.  Words are not harmful.  Ideas are harmful.  One particularly harmful idea is that certain words are so unspeakably horrible that nobody can be allowed to say them for any reason at all.  You want to end racism forever?  Stop freaking the fuck out every time you see the word """"nigger"""".  SERIOUSLY.  I happen to be a Priest (and a Docktor), and saving humanity is just one of my many responsibilities.  Fucks like you make me hate it, but I still do it.  That's what a good person I am.

I forgot what else I was going to complain about.  I mean, I could complain about everything on Wikipedia, not because I am uncivil, but because there are enough Wikipedos to make this community unbearable for normal, well-adjusted individuals such as myself.  If you look at all my page edits, they were all GOOD FOR THE ENCYCLOPEDIA.  Ok, there was one tiny exception - a long time ago, I saw someone changed a caption on Scottish fold to """"Winston Churchill"""".  Someone else reverted it, and I reverted it back.  I felt it was an appropriate caption to that particular image.  But everything else was beneficial to improving the quality of the content.  I may be a little hard on people who are hung up on things that are wrong, but I only do what is right.  That is why I put it on my user page.  I don't do wrong things.  If you try to argue with me, you will be in for a world of hurt.  Butthurt, to be exact.  But you have nobody to blame but yourself.  Unlike you, I actually warn people first.  But no.

"Is Deepak the ruler of the world? 

Let me give you people who love this guy/girl Deepak....An idea of what Deepak is like....He must be some really unhappy person......i promoise you this is what it is like in dealing with Deepak. 

I bring up an issue where im asking why an article does not have more info, or about editing an article, or about taking something out of an article. 

And Deepak wont allow me to make edits. 

So I give Deepak examples and information and trying to back up my edits are legit. 

And Deepak ignores my logic and doesnt give me alot of logic as to why my info is not valid then 

So I try to figure out why Deepak is being so strcit. I remind him that i backed up what i said. That i had information that was logical. And why my edits are good. 

And Deepak calls me a troll and insults me and accuses me of being a nazi lover or something

So I answer every insult, every accustation , and every put down that Deepak gives me. And then i remind him of why my edits are valid.

And Deepak ignores most of what i write and continues to call me a troll. Or a nazi lover. Or other insults. 

I then get annoyed and ask Deepak why is he ignoring most of my logic that i write down? Why does he pick and choose what he wants to answer? Why does he not give me logic in return? 

And Deepak wont reply . 

I then ask other users about making edits and asking them about my logic and giving them my reasons as to why my edits are valid. And some answer and some agree and some dont. 

And Deepak all of a sudden starts responding again....with logic? No....with answers? no....with reasoning? no....with information? no....he tells the other users that im a troll and a nazi and pro India then . 

I then answer all of Deepaks insults. I remind him of why i want edits to be made. I give him my information as to why  my edits are valid then. 

And Deepak goes back calling me a troll, and a nazi, and a pro India dude. 

And this kind of stuff goes on and on and on...you get the idea.....he ignores information you give him. He picks and chooses what he wants to answer. And he doesnt even answer the logic you give him sometimes. But he wastes his time in name calling, and insluts, and putting you down then. 

So then after a while i get annoyed. And i remind him how things got this bad between us. I type and type and type and type just like i am now. 

And Deepak ignores most of what i typed. 

Many times i write him these long replies where i answer all his points, where i tell him why its wrong for him to insult me and put me down, and why its wrong for him to ignore the information i have as to why i want to make an edit, or whatever it is im bringing up then.....and no matter how much i write....even if i write these long replies to him then....even if i answer every point he brings up....he usually either ignores most of what i wrote down....or....he picks and chooses what he wants to answer.....or.....he just responds back by calling me a troll, or accusing me of being pro nazi or something, or accusing me of ignoring his points (which is so not true cus i respond to pretty much everything he says then), or accusing me of not understanding what he is telling me, or just accusing me of being pro India then (which I am) or just insulting me, or just name calling me, or just putting me down. 

So then after a while i get so annoyed cus he's this a guy here then with me now, and so i start to call him names. I call him a dictator. I call him the ruler of wikiepdia. And I tell him how he ignores my points. 

And then Deepak tells me how i cant call him names, and how i cant throw mud at him, and how im breaking wikipedia rules

So then I ask him how comes its ok for him to name call me and i cant? How come its ok for him to throw mud at me but I cant then? How come its ok for him to break Wikipedia's rules but I can't then? 

And Deepak has no logical answer....or....he won't respond to those questions that I ask him then . Or he just ignores what i ask him, and goes back to accusing me of being a troll, or acting like im a pro nazi or something then , or just insult's me in general then......

So then I get more annoyed and call him thing's like a dictator, which as you can see here with our history, this is how he acts.....isn't it true?.....he ignores most of my points and picks and chooses what he wants to answer.....sometimes he won't even answer you at all.....and sometime's he just insults you then . So it's logical if get annoyed and call him a dicator right?

Wrong....Deepak then holds it against you that your name calling him...and threaten's to block you, or report you, or he just tel",1.0

 Watermarks 

I shall remove the obvious ones, the less obvious ones stay. I am allowed to watermark images with anything whatsoever I wish to, even if it's a contradiction, and if you wish me to use up further WP  bandwidth by re-uploading them, that has no effect on me. I can't do anything until this evening, and if any get deleted, I shall reupload them. Yours without respect (talk|email) 
You could have the grace to reply. I said that I'd deal with them this evening, but only the ones where the watermark is visible from the page. So *** off (talk|email) 
I am planning to re-upload them with less obtrusive watermarks, such as that on Image:Bliss parody.jpg. (talk|email) 
It wasn't vandalism; I used an external link as per your instructions, which incidentally I'm not bound to follow. I am certainly on the verge of requesting mediation, as you are disrupting my life, never mind WP, to make a point. I will tell you one more time: any images are better than none. If you wish to get your own pix of all the concerned images, you're damn welcome to try, but they are GFDL therefore there's no grounds for removal. (talk|email) 
PS - I shall add the external link again, not as an image, and if you remove it I shall make a formal complaint to the Wikimedia Foundation, and the Information Commissioner in London. (talk|email) 

, your conduct is a little off in this matter. While I'm all for discussing the issues with users, let's keep it civil please? Thanks.  (talk) 

 I disagree, Rob - it is far more than """"a little"""" off. Images watermarked as such are not in any way appropriate for Wikipedia. This is an encyclopædia, not a pet image project. If """"TheDoctor10"""" isn't happy to play ball, he can go elsewhere.

I am proposing a change to the image use policy to forbid watermarked images. Please voice an opinion at Wikipedia_talk:Image_use_policy#User-created_images -Thanks - talk 

I edit from the United Kingdom, and under the 1990 Computer Misuse Act, the editing of information online is illegal, without permission. The button at the top of every page that says """"Edit this page"""", among other things, constitutes that permission, while the policies and guidelines form conditions. Since there is no condition against my image, it has a legal right to be there. Q.E.D. (talk|email) 
True, but therefore your addition fails under the same logic. Also, Wikimedia own the servers, it's their right to delete it. 13ID:540053 
Apologies to Ed for invading his talk page, but what a load of rubbish! Wikipedia are under no legal obligation whatsoever to host your images, regardless of whether they meet any policy. I have no idea under what flawed logic you presume that the fact you can edit Wikipedia means that your edits must legally be accepted. If the Computer Misuse Act states that the editing of information online is illegal without permission, that implies that editing with permission is legal, and nothing more. Furthermore, by your logic, I have the legal right to edit Wikipedia, and remove your images... I fail to see what on earth you intend to tell your lawyer, but I don't imagine the Wikimedia board are too concerned... └''''''/talk┐

I understand the confusion. You would think that since a primary source is a first-hand account, it would be the most reliable. However, the person or group involved could have a biased viewpoint. Also, there may be multiple viewpoints on the event in question that differ from one another. That's when a secondary source comes in. A secondary source's author is """"one step removed"""" from the event reducing the chance of bias, and often uses several primary sources to form an opinion, evaluation, and/or conclusion. Furthermore, secondary sources are more likely to be published – the editorial oversight of the publishing process is extremely valuable here. It helps us avoid original research. One of the biggest problems with Wikipedians relying on primary sources is that they often find themselves forming their own conclusions, whether intentionally or not, which would be considered original research.

If you would prefer right now to not have a Wikipedia article I`ll gladly comply with your wish. Some organizations don` t really want to be on Wikipedia for various reasons.

History of Primal Therapy article

I read through the recent discussions on Talk:Primal_therapy. I also added two more comments to the Talk:Arthur_Janov page. Did you send an email enquiry? The 1973 date for France D's marriage to Art is without credibility. After the divorce, to Vivian's great credit, she avoided the temptation to publicly humiliate Arthur Janov. After all, he wrote in the original Primal Scream: """"It is instructive to note that married couples who have both gone through Primal Therapy have never separated."""" (chapter 12). And according to France D. Janov's own admission in the Primal Center's Video Series 2, she enrolled at the Primal Institute because excessive marihuana use had broken down her gates. So it's a fact that Art married a former patient.

My feeling is that despite being tagged as a stub, the content of the Arthur Janov article is just about right for an encyclopedia entry. It isn't really the place to dissect Janov's reputation. I know it happens in other Wikipedia biographies, but in many cases it has got out of hand. I agree with your suggestion on the Primal therapy Talk page that this kind of material belongs in a separate History of Primal Therapy article. The Conocer piece doesn't strike me as a sound source of verifiable information, so I put together some links to articles which can be found online:

If you type Emotional Intelligence into Google the No.1 result is Steve Hein's eqi.org website. He interviewed a former patient who attended Arthur Janov's Primal Center in the late 1990's. You can find his interview notes here, labelled """"cautionary note"""".

Janov's bio on the Primal Center website states: """"The latest research conducted at Dr. Janov’s Primal Center on the effects of Primal Therapy on the brain was performed by Dr. Erik Hoffman, former Professor of Neurophysiology at Copenhagen University."""" You can read  what Erik Hoffmann, Ph.D., is doing now at Hoffmann's website.

On this page you can find a transcript of Dr. E. Michael Holden's account of what happened to him after he left the Primal Institute.

Carol Mither's book, Therapy Gone Mad, identifies case histories from Janov's first two books that were written by defendants in the lawsuits against The Center for Feeling Therapy.  Simon ( )

Thanks, Simon - Why can't you create an account like normal Wikipedians complete with a talk page? I don't think the History idea will come to much, There is just insufficient well sourced information to make much out of it - especially in view of Cgingold's latest analyses on the Primal Therapy talk page regarding derogatory statements about living individuals. I have already read the Michael Holden swan song twice - sad case.  

You seem to be applying two standards of evidence. The Primal Therapy article gives an outline of primal theory based on Arthur Janov's books alone, which were written to attract paying customers to his exclusive and expensive private treatment center. Last September, I wrote in the Primal Therapy talk page: Will the article have something to offer readers who want to know about Stettbacher's method, or the International Primal Association, or the plethora of copycat primal centers that flourished in the 1970s? There is sufficient well sourced information available for a history article  for a start, two books about The Center for Feeling Therapy, Erik Hoffmann's bio, and the transcript of Dr. E. Michael Holden's audio tape which was played a number of times at the IPA convention in 1983. The books by Carol Mithers and Tomas Videgård are already referenced in the main article. I have a copy of Videgård's book, by the way. Also, Professor Steven Rose wrote a one-page account of his research with Arthur Janov in Lifelines:
""""As Janov had hoped, it turned out that before therapy, the quantity of these particular receptors in his client's platelets was considerably below normal. Within six months of therapy, clients' depression had lifted, and the biochemical and immunological measures I was making approached the average for 'normal' non-depressed people of the same age and sex.""""
Further down the same page he added:
""""I obtained similar biochemical results when, a couple of years later, I did a similar study with depressed clients going through other, less dramatic forms of psychotherapy, so I suspect that in such cases the therapist matters more than the therapeutic theory.""""

How did you decide that bukkake always implies a female subject? 

Also, just because a word has a historical meaning doesn't mean that it can't ever mean anything else as culture develops. The word rap meant """"to knock, as on a door"""" up until the late 70s for example. Would you deny the more modern use of the term? The English language has no board to regulate it, as French does with the L'Académie française, so you have no basis for defining what the word means. We have groups and documents that define the proper use of words like """"you're"""" and """"your"""", for example, but none such for words like bukkake. If it can be shown that it is used in a particular way, that is valid. My personal belief is that there is no need for the qualifier """"gay"""", just as there is no need to call men having anal sex """"gay anal sex"""", but that's really irrelevent. 

I think it is important to make clear the historical implications, but not to deny that we are currently creating and modifying language. Even the fact that we have taken the word bukkake, """"splash"""", from Japan and created this very specific connotation of splashing not just anything, but specifically semen and specifically onto a person's face shows that this term is elastic and subject not to rules that we impose on it, but by the meaning that it has to the people who use it.

 Hie DVdm. I was writing what follows while you made your edit. I can't right now, but I will coming to review in detail your example.
Thanks Johnuniq for your advice and input. Concerning the actual statement, I had already thought that after clearing things up with DVdm, I would rephrase it into something in the lines of """"He is an iconic and inspirational reference for the generation growing up in the late 1970s, early 1980s."""" Adding """"to some of the generation"""" should clear your objection about the absence of stats. But that's not the really important issue here. The fact is that it is ethically improper from me and from Wikipedia to declare that the (you call it blog) site is not a reliable source here, but then find that the links and statements in """"Inertia Coupling"""" or """"Alexander Abian"""" are significant enriching contributions to the users of Wikipedia, and the sourced site is reliable there. BTW, in these two and the few other topics the source is mentioned, the statements leading to the source links would qualify as synthesis. It would be highly objectionable from Wikipedia to keep those links unchallenged for the time being, and when someone gets around to rewriting the original material in the specific blog posts, the links will be trashed out. At this point 1) The sentence being vague and inaccurate can be corrected. 2) It seems that if you articulate a sentence validated by some sort of source that is not a direct quote, in most cases some synthesis is involved. 3) There is still the issue of the site being a reliable source. It seems to me that the Wikipedia efforts to keep the wackos with weird theories at bay, is leading editors to substitute verifiability, intelligibility and common sense by arguments of authority. This would set me going into a long winded argument about what is happening to Wikipedia, once lauded as the place """"to come as you are,"""" becoming stiff, purely factual and tight in such a way that it carries a lot of knowledge but no understanding. This in turn carries into a discussion about public education, and the work that Carl Sagan is known to the general public for. Cosmos was not about this marble statue said so but instead these are the reasons why we think so. To me the posts in the disputed site I linked to are interesting (but that maybe just my own personal opinion) and Wikipedia users having them available is positive, constructive and enriching for Wikipedia, and that's the reason I linked to them in the first place. Throwing them out, all of them, seems like excluding a whole plethora of good things, the baby with the bath water, because a Wikipedia directive says so, just because it does, not noticing the directives were written to prevent bad things from happening, it would seem to me, not to exclude good things by statute. So the reliable source rules are something I would like to discuss a bit more at length.   """,0.0

 FISHERQUEEN ( Actually A TRASHY DUSTBIN ) IS BLOCKED IN LIFE FOREVER AND FOR LIFE INDEFINITELY 

 FISHERQUEEN IS ACTUALLY A TRASHY DUSTBIN WHO IS BLOCKED IN LIFE AND FOR LIFE INDEFINITELY

It can be so obviously seen that you have no life in reality and hence you carry on with editing pages on Wikipedia,which is another big joke, like you. In fact, it is jokers like you that make Wikipedia an unreliable piece of crap that the world laughs on. You thought you can block users who edit articles that are wrongly written to project a """"good"""" image like that C-grade item song sleaze actress Payal Rohatgi. On the account of hello5678, when I edited to write the truth, since I work with the media and knew the actual truth, you did what you knew best - to block accounts and even have the foolish audacity to write that it did not seem I was a journalist. Your block anyways went futile ( like all your remaining blocks on other users go, and future blocks will be going ) since as I had said, there are a million computers to comment and reply from. It just depends on my wish if I want to respond to idle losers like you and whether I have the time to do so. Once and for all, I am doing it this time, and won't remove time for worthless people like you again.
 
You had some advice on how I should spend my """"blocked time"""" by reading WP:Dispute pages on Wikipedia so that I have better ideas on dealing with disputes. Actually ,you need better ideas to deal with life. I am not foolish like you to spend any amount of my time bothering about rubbish written by stupid people like you who have no work in real life and spend days editing pages on Wikipedia/ Scribblebook that no one bothers to read. Some people are just unfortunate like you and 2over0. And if you are troubled by my calling that actress """"sleazy"""", then that's your problem. Cos that's the only work she has done and the press uses precisely that term while referencing her work. You also spoke about writing """"accurate"""" information on wikipedia. Ironic, when you don't even bother finding out what is accurate, and spend endless hours blocking, and acting admin as if it is an important position in your life. Oh wait, that may be the only position you probably have or will have ever in your unfortunate life.
 
Carry on with your scribble game. And if you feel threatened by media exposure, then that shows you knew you were wrong. It's only when people are wrong that they feel threatened. Pity your personality. Also, you ended by writing that """" it's clear you aren't a journalist, and have no means of carrying out your threat """" - LOL. Sad, that you lived in that illusion. For JOKERS like you who are totally idle,and who scribble away in virtual pages on Wiki-scribble-pedia, will obviously withdraw from the truth. You yourself have no idea at all if I am a journalist, and you write that it's clear that I am not. Well, you are also inane and a clown to fool yourself. I had all means, and the said article has already been published. I had NO TIME to let you know, since I am a busy person, unlike you and do not find time to come scribble on virtual pages that clowns like you , 2OVERO, 2/0, AKERANS, MANAGERARC, FISHERQUEEN (yeah, we named you again - Suck it up),  KURU etc. do all your life. You will find that information, depending on which Godforsaken part of the world you live in.  And like last time, you can go ahead and block me this time too. For , no one cares two hoots for your silly blocking games. We do have a life, unlike losers like you. Maybe its time for you to go fish in real life, so that you can come anywhere remotely close to having a life - LOL.
SO, LOSERQUEEN, GROW UP and GET A LIFE, You IDLE CLOWN OR ELSE, YOU WILL REMAIN A LOSER ALL YOUR LIFE. WHO CARES ANYWAY WHAT INANE, PUERILE LOSERS LIKE YOU DO IN THEIR LIVES. Cos all you know best is to play edit and block games on your scribblebook called wikipedia. Scribble on cos anyway no one cares and I most certainly don't. Time for you to go fishing then, LOSERQUEEN. And I wont bother to check any replies or anything else ever, cos I dont have time unlike Idle LOSERS like you, Loserqueen.

 While I respect the fact that you've obviously given this some thought, a few counterpoints: 1) Every single state in the union, with the possible exception of Rhode Island (mostly because it's so damn tiny), is a """"transitional"""" state with the features you mentioned. Examples: California includes ghettos, really rich gated comunities, hick towns (such as Watsonville, or virtually any city more than 100 miles from the coast), and the Bay Area. New York? Same deal, if you've ever been to upstate New York you'll see. And of course, the reverse is true too - a lot of Texas is really nice, progressive even. I've heard some less-than-terrible things about Birmingham, Alabama. Even Okla-dumbass-homa has some okay parts of Tulsa.

"Regarding AZ helping Ahmed Ressam get to Canada  my reading of his CSR Transcript is exactly the opposite.  He asked Ahmed Ressam if he could get him five (stolen?) Canadian passports, because he was tired of being a stateless person in Pakistan.

Regarding whether AZ ran the Khaldan camp  didn't he testify that he hadn't paid a visit to Khaldan for years?  I thought his testimony confirmed that he was part of the camp's management team.  But, if the camp had been a college I think his role(s) would be closest to that of the college registrar and placement officer.  A registrar confirms that applicants grades are in order, and officially informs them that they have been admitted.  AZ ran houses where he formed an assessment as to whether applicants were good candidates for training.  And, once they finished their training, he helped those who wanted to go fight in Chechnya or Israel to slip into those conflict zones.  He had helped grads slip into Bosnia, during the civil war there.  

I think it would have been more accurate to say Ibn al Shaykh al Libi ran the camp.  His location was a secret for four years.  He was found in a Libyan prinson in April, by human rights workers, who conducted an initial interview with him.  And a few weeks later the Libyans reported he committed suicide.  I really think it would serve public safety if we had heard his version  his pre-torture versions  of what the camp did.",0.0

I can help you create an RFC, but you need to propose a neutrally-worded sentence saying what change you want to make. Do you want to add:

You can propose this in the RfC, but people who have commented so far are unlikely to support that. You would be hoping that the listing of the RfC would bring in more contributors who might agree with you. It sounds like the current contributors want everything to be extremely well-sourced to respected scholarship, and they don't want anything said beyond what is known for sure.

 UFC AFDs 
Those were never transcluded to the AfD page so there's probably not a lot of point them existing.  I'm a bit pushed for time today, so if you want to remove the AfD banners from the articles, I'll delete the AfD pages when I get the chance.   
I haven't been able to spend much time on Wikipedia lately.  Looks like they've been """"officially"""" listed as AfDs.  I'll leave them alone for now.    

 Jake Bostwick 
I've only nominated a few, very obvious MMA people before.  Bostwick was deleted via AfD discussion.  A speedy delete on grounds of it being deleted before was denied.  To me, he still fails WP:MMANOT, but I'm in no way a MMA expert.  What do you think?   
At first glance it appears that Bostwick hasn't fought at the """"highest level"""" of MMA as required by WP:ATHLETE (or whatever the guideline is these days) and WP:MMANOT.  If I had an interest in having the article removed, I would AfD it again.    

Hello, It has been brought to my attention from an outside source about this discussion. Can I first point out that Jake Bostwick is a former UCMMA middleweight champion and currently the UCMMA welterweight champion? UCMMA is, along with BAMMA and Cage Warriors, the biggest MMA promotion in the United Kingdom. 

Secondly, after glancing over WP:MMANOT and WP:ATHLETE, I see that they are indeed guidelines. Now I may be cut from a different cloth from you two in terms of how we see what a guideline is but to me, a guideline is optional when it comes to following it, meaning that they cannot be used in AfDs as the sole reason why to delete any article. 

Thirdly, I have spent much time working on the page (as well as being the creator of the page), I have found very strong sources from websites such as The Sun, The Mirror as well as finding information that goes beyond it from being a 'typical' mixed martial artist's Wikipedia page, as it has information about him being on a reality tv show called Party Wars, and being the headline of an article in which he got into issues with the police for his tactics whilst working as a Wheel Clamper only strengthens his notability. The very sources on him alone helps him pass WP:GNG, which is all you need to pass a page on Wikipedia in my opinion.

I would welcome constructive ideas about improving the page even more, but to talk about deleting the page without informing me first of this discussion I find is a bit disrespectful towards me, however I fairness to you we haven't exactly known each other for a while, so now I have adding myself to the topic and given the facts of the page's position on Wikipedia, now we can talk to help improve the page even more.

Since you filed the SPI, I wanted to update you that I've reversed the block.  I requested another editor to review the case, and while there are a lot of coincidences, he felt it was borderline enough based on behavior, that the block should be reversed and instead just monitor the situation.  I had some reservations going into the block, but it seemed likely, however, I fully respect the review and would ask we all give the benefit of the doubt in this case.  I completely see why you reported it (I did block, after all), so there is no question as to your faith here.  Just wanted to update you.  - 2¢  ©  Join WER

"A consistent conceptualization of phylogenies 
Phylogenies (i.e., dictomously branching processes) are processes that involve things, that is, objects, and as such have to be modeled by Object-Oriented Modeling in order to be consistent with the distinction of objects. Darwins model of evolution illustrates biological species as objects, and is thus no different from phylogenies of other kinds of objects (like asexually reproducing cells or mitochondria). Now, as an Object-Oriented Model, the model actually represents two consecutive objects (i.e., two objects in a row) by each of its internal lines (i.e., lines between nodes): one after a node and one before a node; the former belonging to the category (i.e., concept) 'objects after nodes' and the latter to the category 'objects before nodes'. If the model includes all objects of a certain category, then both of these make up this category. In summary: phylogenies consist of two categories (i.e., concepts) of objects: objects before nodes and objects after nodes, and if the phylogeny includes all things of a category, then these two categories make up this category.

(Cladistics, or cladism as I prefer to call it, confuses the concept 'objects after nodes' with the concept 'objects before nodes' by defining lines between nodes as single things, thereby confusing category with object, that is kind with thing, thus confusing conceptualization itself. The approach is actually a return to a pre-scientific stage, this time denying the incompatibility between pattern and process instead of acknowledging it and solving it consistently. It is a return alley that no scientist had ever expected anyone to advocate. If this approach could ever be proved to be correct, then it would mean that reality only exists in our own heads. Luckily, Einstein's discovery that time is relative to space falsifies the approach (i.e., claim), and this it did even before the approach was born. Cladism was thus shown to be wrong before it emerged). Consist (presently at 83.254.20.53  )",0.0

"""::::::Agreed, although it means bloating the alternative title by yet another word. I was concentrating on the Polish attitude here, as it clearly provides the starting point for the article at hand. Obviously, if the article is to be written from a supra-national perspective, at least the Czech experience needs to be included. Czechoslovakia, being the only functioning democracy in the region by the 1930s, had closer ties with the West than Poland did, and was """"betrayed"""" in a much more obvious and tangible way than Poland was: The West politically accepted the country's territorial mutilation, which was not the case with Poland. 

That said, I am not sure if the inclusion of countries such as Finland, the Baltics, Yugoslavia, or even Ukraine (which had never been independent in the first place) is a good idea. While the West could have arguably done more to assist any of these societies before and after the war, I think that the article's focus should be on Poland and Czechoslovakia in order not do dilute the whole issue. After all, there were dissidents in Germany and the Soviet Union, too, who were harbouring grudges towards Western politicians because of their appeasement policy.  19:06, 17 Oct 2004 (UTC)

"""::The CTMU is not passing itself off as an """"academic"""" theory. It can't, because Langan is not a member of academia. But then again, a theory need not be academic to be notable. For example, print and television journalists and their readers and viewing audiences can deem things notable as well. Nor do academics have a monopoly on logical or factual correctness, scholarly integrity, or intellectual merit, except possibly in the well-indoctrinated minds of some academics themselves (and of course, their aspiring apprentices, whose eager anticipation of scholastic glory sometimes inflates their academic snobbery to blimpish proportions).

Byrgenwulf complains that """"we chaps"""" are not the sole arbiters of what belongs in the article. This is correct. To his credit, he invites others to tag his assertions. However, this is a bit specious, for having belatedly come to the realization that he has no relevant, verifiable assertions to make, he is now specializing in challenging the assertions of others. Thus, we now find him imperiously and rather comically demanding that every one of Langan's assertions receive a separate citation, when this is flatly unnecessary because the source material in which those assertions are made is already directly linked to the article. 

It is important for Byrgenwulf to understand that he has exactly the same burden of proof as his opponents. Not only must he provide a legitimate citation for anything he wishes to add to the article, but given that the article already links to ample source material, anything he wants to remove or qualify must be proven false, irrelevant, or non-neutral. Unfortunately, he hasn't yet been able to lock onto this signal. He still labors under the assumption that like some sort of Ultimate Bureaucrat, he can sit at his keyboard and demand an infinite amount of verification without verifying anything himself.  

By now, everyone involved in this matter has come to a stark realization: neither Byrgenwulf, nor any of his tiny but dedicated band of confederates, HAS any citations or other sources of verification for their own accusations. They are merely using the article, which is faithful to the material it cites, to prosecute their philosophical bias against its topic, the CTMU, which was deemed notable and newsworthy by several international periodicals and news networks. They do not like what the CTMU says; the article on the CTMU reports on what the CTMU says, and what Langan and the press say about the CTMU; hence, they do not like the article on the CTMU. 

This conflation of the article with the theory is reflected in Byrgenwulf's transparent strategy of attacking the theory through the article, attempting to dispose of the message by killing the messenger. Meanwhile, he seemingly fails to register the fact that he is himself in glaring violation of Wikipedia verifiability policy, and that his all-too-evident editorial bias is in massive violation of NPOV as well. Oozing contempt, Byrgenwulf has rumbled into the middle of the CTMU article with a load of summary demands, snide remarks, and self-righteous, factually worthless criticism...but not one relevant citation in hand! Nothing he says is verifiable; as we have now repeatedly seen, he cannot even be trusted on matters in which he claims to be an expert. This makes it very difficult, if not impossible, to take his demands seriously.

"Request to Unblock
I began writing the following statement (excepting its two postscripts) before I was blocked. I suspect that User: AuburnPilot had me blocked, in order to prevent me from complaining to administrators about his misconduct. Although I was directed to request an unblock of User: Physicq210, who had blocked me, requesting such of the latter would require that I censor myself, and write as though User: Physicq210 had acted in good faith, and was one of the good guys. That would be surreal, and would give User: Physicq210 a moral legitimacy belied by his actions. And so, the following request for unblocking is directed at any administrator BUT User: Physicq210, but since I’m not a devious sort, I have nothing against the latter reading this. Indeed, I want User: Physicq210 to read it. For if I can be banned from Wikipedia for standing up to censors, then it is vastly preferable to go down fighting, than to go down the long dark road of self-abnegation and self-censorship, including the use of bad English. After all, if I wanted to be a lackey, I could go to graduate school.

WIKI Administrators’ Notice Board Incidents
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/Incidents

User: AuburnPilot

A few days ago, User: AuburnPilot began stalking me, checking wherever I had made edits, and going to the articles in question and vandalizing them. He or she has been manipulating Wikipedia rules as cover for what is clearly political censorship. User: AuburnPilot cannot even stand for Wikipedia readers to find out about factual material that upsets his political applecart through footnotes. Zero tolerance!

He claims of any source he politically dislikes, that it is either “spam” or a “blog” (or “POV,” another favorite dodge for those at Wikipedia seeking to censor those who fail to conform to their own POV), even though the one source is a previously published, classic magazine article otherwise unavailable on the Web (http://geocities.com/nstix/waronpolice.html), which the author has seen fit to publish on his Web site, and the other source is the longest, most thorough exposé yet published on the Duke rape hoax (http://vdare.com/stix/070113_duke.htm).

Note that I am not even talking about censoring writing within articles, since I hadn’t done any writing on the articles in question: Crystal Gail Mangum, Michael Nifong, 2006 Duke University lacrosse team scandal and Racial profiling.
I’ve been involved in edit wars before, though I have never been the aggressor, and have never initiated an elective edit war, though given the self-assurance that aggressors such as User: AuburnPilot exude, perhaps I ought to reconsider that position. It seems that aggressors rule here.

The reason I am making a formal complaint is that User: AuburnPilot has tonight upped the ante, threatening to have me banned
(http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:70.23.199.239&redirect;=no), if I do not surrender to his censorship. Should you find for me, please serve this individual with the wikiquivalent of a cease-and-desist order. Should you, however, find for the censor, please provide an Index of banned publications and a list of official wikicensors.

P.S. January 19, 2007 115A EST. Since beginning this complaint, I see that User: AuburnPilot has in fact succeeded at getting a crony, User: Physicq210, to block me, thus not only getting administrative support in censoring me, but preventing me from responding to his thuggery. (And no, I am not going to use cutesy, euphemistic language. If I were into such deception, I would have become a liar, er, lawyer, and would be worthless as an encyclopedist.) And I was unable to e-mail User: Physicq210 because I am not logged in and “You must be logged in and have a valid authenticated e-mail address in your preferences to send e-mail to other users.” (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Emailuser/Physicq210)

If this isn’t cyber-Stalinism, I don’t know what is! So, let me get this straight. Stalking and censoring an editor while using the equivalent of smiley faces (User: AuburnPilot’s penchant for saying “Thank you” after vandalizing one’s links) is “civil,” but complaining about such abuse counts as “spam, disruption, incivility, and personal attacks.” If that is verily so, then 2 + 2 = 5.

Unfortunately, judging from previous """"warnings,"""" some people here have a rather unusual view of what personal attacks are. Pointing out that the individuals accusing me of using sockpuppets were incorrect  and in fact the two main people making the accusations have been harassing me for months and had used sockpuppets and meat puppets themselves for getting around edit conflicts and to stack votes on a Request for Admin proceding, as pointed out by several editors at the time  certainly cannot be considered a personal attack. Pointing out that admins did not have any actual policy basis to make the blocks is not a personal attack (and it has, in fact, been confirmed by the overruling of the blocks more than once). 

Frankly, if you are looking for personal attacks, try yourself for your AGF-violating attacks on my actions based upon limited information and actually misleading information given to you by other individuals, or David Gerard for claiming that I am """"trolling"""" when all i am doing is defending myself from false accusations of others. It's very clear that a number of people here need to realize that the very things they are accusing me of and trying to justify for a block are exactly what they themselves are doing from behind the pretense of trying to solve things.

If you want to start blocking for incivility, I might suggest removing David Gerard for a while for his actions, or Elonka for falsely claiming that I was using sockpuppets or that I was harassing her, or the sysop whose very talk page says he's going to go around blocking people no questions asked and in fact did so after I caught him restoring placing illegal information on how to pirate software an article talk page.

 MY STATEMENT 

AND WHAT IS IT I DID EXACTLY TO BE BANNED?
WILL SOMEBODY PLEASE EXPLAIN?
You are obviously not aware of what is goinf ´g on I am ban for not contributing at all with the talk page!! what ? I am the one who asked for this mediation for more than 2 weeks ago and it was for something else than that and this snowskinner who was asked to bring the arbitration knows it perfectly. And i am the one working out ot bring the two best cosmolog in the world to look at those thesis, ans I am the one who did contributed the most in this affair together with Igor Bogdanov, at the refute of those falsifications of evidencies presented here by ybm and his acolytes.
I was ban because ybm had been ban and couldn't stand it.
But where he was ban 24 hours for insulting repaeatridly people and calling Igor Bogdanov a bastard 3 times and for having on several occassions oversteped the 3RR rule, I was ban 3 x 24 hours for having presented an article who was evaluated by Bidhonene who is a very endeared friend of YBM, for not being so usefull as she wish.
An article containing of course a serie of evidenscies who didn't have been shown before, and who constiture a major block against the conspiratorial arguments of ybm and his gang.
Just as she did it here on my talk page when she deleeted it all, and vnever reinserted it, a precious document proving the ´factual connection between YBM and this Voyer who infatuated this whole affair.
It was YBM who had invited his friend on my talkpage, until he realized that i had an arbitration going on that was about this.
Bishonen blocked me 20 minutes after her protegé had been blocked.
i dont see any of her interventions in this talk page concerning the insults of rjb and ybm, nor concerning their cynical and very empty and longs comments about my mediation on the talk page tonight.
You can read my articles yourself and see how hard I was fighting to make sure that the situation will not degenerate further, and to calm down the spirit.
She didn't make an intervention there to ask rjb and ybm to stop their acction and provocating attitudes, nor accused them for saying nothing nor removed their articles for not improving the talk page, nor contributing with anything on it.
She has already been told to don't interfeer anymore on this talk page because she is unable to differentiate between  her liking and her work as an admi.
She does not follow the rules and do a very destructiv work, using retaliation and arbitrarious judgement all the time, and always something who arranged ybm very much.
She even do revert for him and use her status to commit illegitimate stuff.
The arbitration should have been about this too.
They are using the fact that mediator Nicholas turnbull is out for a week to do their bad deeds.
And this snowsnippers know that what he does is out of hand, and that he should never have done it.
He even insulted Nicholas turnbull.
Easy when people aren't there to defend themselves.
Wiki english is a spot on the face of Wikipédia, admi are behaving like sabotors and vandaliser and encourage riot, and abuse of their knoledge and power to undermine actions made to refrein their wrong doing.

This has to stop.
I asked for a mediation and an arbitration comity for more than two weeks and Sowspinners actions are completely unlegitimate.
He has stollen MY mediation and MY arbitration request.
This don't go and has to be aborted.
I do not recognise the actual arbitration for being legitimate, and thereby ask all to boycot it.

None of the involved administrator can in anyway be part of the arbitration comity or of the arbitration.
It is a close debate and not an arena game.
THis arbitration was supposed to be hold secret, as snowspinner knows very well, and took some very unlucky initiatives from the very beginning.
He is an idiot to have done that, and has no sens of responsability, nor of maturity, and cannot be trusted.
He must be removed as well.
i dont accept what happened tonight. There was absolutly no reasons for me to be blocked and certainly not for 3 days.
If I say fuck! like ybm nothing happen, but if I bring precious evidencies, so I am ban and the evidencies confiscated and destroy yes, and detroyed as they have been alredy here several times.
This is the sign of a totalitarian system, and wiki english has became a totalitarian system, where the judged perform the judgement, and were all proofs are stollen and destroyed and were disturbing people are threaten for their meaning and impert to say more, and blocked away.

13)Aurangzeb ! I have no trust in your oaths anymore. (you have written that) God is one and that he is witness (between us).
14)I don't have trust even equivalent to a drop of water in your generals (Wazir Khan, nawab of Sirhind Punjab, Raja Ajmer chand (rajput hilly king) and other hilly kings who came to me with oaths of Quran and cow that I will be given safe passage out of Anandgarh fort. But they all were telling lies
15) If anyone trusts you on your oaths of Quran that person is bound to be doomed in the end.
16)If anyone comes under the shadow of Huma bird, no one can lay its hands on it-not even a brave cow.
17)If a man sits behind the back of a lion neither anyone can catch him nor a goat or a sheep or a deer can even pass nearby.
(Aurangzeb ! I stand in shadow of the Almighty and your men who are like goats,sheep and deer could not harm me inspite of your deceptions.)
18)If I had deceived by taking oath on Holy Quran like the way you have done, I would not have bought my dear fighters to this position of disadvantage (by bringing them out of Anandgarh fort).
IN VERSES FROM 19 TO 41 BELOW, GURU SAHIB GAVE AN ACCOUNT OF THE BATTLE OF CHAMKAUR FOUGHT ON 22ND DECEMBER,1704 AND THE REASONS THAT FORCED HIM TO TAKE UP THE SWORD AGAINST THE MUGHALS AND HILLY RAJPUT KINGS

20)That the promise breakers launched a surprise attack with their swords, arrows and guns.
21)It was out of sheer helplessness that I came in the battle field.(Having thus decided) I came with all the battle plans and munitions.
22)When all stratagem employed for (solving) a problem are exhausted, only then taking your hand to the sword is legitimate.
(This is the most quoted of Zafarnamah.300 years ago, Guru Gobind singh ji had laid down the circumstances when a person or a nation can pick up the sword against the other)
23)What trust can I have on your oath on Quran ? Otherwise you tell why should I have taken path of taking up the sword.
24)I do not know that this person (Aurangzeb) is cunning like a fox.Otherwise I would never have come to this place that is Chamkaur (by vacating Anandgarh on the false oaths of Aurangzeb and his men).
25)If any person believes an oath on Quran ,he should neither be tied (arrested) nor killed.",0.0

So this is the """"bring the issues to your attention"""" on my part. See this 3RR request  filed by User:Kudzu1.

The problem is - and notice that a CU has not even gotten around to the SPI I filed - that by the time the CUs get around to considering these cases, the person(s) behind these accounts have already thrown them away and moved onto new SPAs which keep doing the same thing.

Nope, I didn't read the guide to appealing, didn't have time. The user in question IS engaged in harassment, I've been doing this long enough to know and I can prove it. He/she immediately placed a threatening notice of blocking me permanently on my user page, reverted the article while I was in the midst of editing it (my second pass, couldn't even preview changes), then changed his/her mind as to my real wiki-sin, since the onus for proving the Doris Day available as PD on archive.org was on him/her not me and the usual span for pre-Bern had expired long ago, ... decided my REAL sin was Original Research (oh noes), and continued to revert based on that. Does OR add clutter? Sure it can, but if the user in question was REALLY concerned about that, about the quality of the article and about extraneous details, WHY DIDN'T HE/SHE EVEN NOTICE two paragraphs already there, comprising about 1/3 of the entire article, dealt with Norman Schwarzkopf, an unrelated book and an unrelated ice cream store name? I'll tell you why: the user wasn't engaged in good-faith/goodwill editing and the normal back-and-forth that leads to better articles. He/she was involved in blocking input to the article. Why? Was it personal against me, or was it to preserve the existing content of the article, including the false claims and extraneous material not even concerned with ther subject at hand? I can only speculate, but I'd guess it's some sort of power trip and wiki-bullying. I don't really have time for this. I have made a fair number of very good edits over the years and have usually refrained from saying anything that isn't directly related to content and improving articles. I could pretend this user didn't do what he/she did, but I'm wasting my own time here and I don't really have a stake in any such pretense. I don't have any stake in improving this article either, no dog in the race, I just see how it can be improved and made more informative. As a long-term wikipedia user and editor, I don't see any problem in jumping in and fixing something. I almost expect some sort of pushback now, but not over completely minor edits which are very good and on-target in very minor stub-like articles. The problem isn't me here, it's that if people such as the user in question can get away with this sort of behavior, and they are getting away with it, wikipedia becomes a much poorer place, a playground filled with bullies rather than a library where we can all learn and share. Also, I don't recal ever having called him/her a bot, I think you put those words in my mouth, perhaps inadvertently. His/her behavior is malicious, but probably not malware, just the normal human collection of problems. I think this user should be warned against trying to be a gatekeeper, he/she isn't quite qualified for that at this point anyway, and it's having a very chilling effect across wikipedia. I won't egnage in a battle of the wikipedia rule acronyms, I will continue to write in English, and to read articles on wikipedia in English, and to think of ways to improve them in English. I am fully aware of how the terms """"vandlism"""" are used and misused here, and most of the rest of the wikijargon. Nothing new under the sun here. If you read the edits I made carefully, and note the times of the reverts and the history of actions by that other user, you will see I'm not off the mark here at all. I know what's going on.

"Dunfermline article and new pictures for the Kirkcaldy collage 

hello again. i've been looking at the paragraph about the Kingsgate Shopping Centre on the economy section. both sources do not indicate that the shopping centre was built in the 1980s nor is there any reference to the centre car park having two levels. me and you know that the centre was built in the 1980s (specifically between 1983 and 1985), if you want make reference to it, use A Century of Dunfermline or Dunfermline: The Post-War Years. but then, i never thought it was that important how old the centre was, anyway. about the two levels on the car park, it is actually three if you've read the sources.

also, i think you should reinstate info on the actual size of the extension and where this took place. you might also want to say that the extension was built on the site of the old bus station and car park (info is there on the reference Kingsgate extension on schedule for August 2008 opening by Mivan). as we both probably want to get this article to GA, i would remove all references to the word locate within that section. this is one of many words or phrases that should be avoided if aiming for GA status. that's why when i originally wrote that paragraph on the Kingsgate and other retail areas, i specifically kept the use of the word in question to a minimum. if it isn't dealt with now, it will be at a later date. 

that aside, i have a new picture of the Beveridge Park which i submitted to Mutt Lucker's home page. (it is now on his talk page if you want to see it) Mutt Lucker thinks it is a good effort and i would like to add it to the collage to replace the picture of the Beveridge Park Pond. as well as this, i have another new picture of the Old Kirk Tower (which was inspired by one on the undiscovered scotland website; the clock has been restored since that pic.) and would like to upload it.",0.0

"""Kenneth Tennyson's reckless behavior in other forums==

As far as Kenneth Tennyson bashing other authors, here is an exerpt from a book review on Amazon.com:

Founder of the homemade Mushindo Karate movement, never studied under a legitimate teacher, or any martial art teacher, never set foot in Asia, completely disproven, shown to have plagiarized many photos and other materials from other published written sources. Of course he claims to have studied under masters in Tibet, and been a disciple of Okinawan Karate teachers - since disproven by such worthy sources as Gorge Mattson, et al. Was involved in an abusive sex scandal with several female students a few years back (""""Sleep with me and I'll enlighten you"""" kinda thing), uses abusive and coercive tactics to control what ex-students say at him, a propaganda liemaster. 

The person he is bashing is none other than Terrence Dukes (or the real Frank Dukes from the movie Bloodsport)

While putting others down, Kenny brags, or advertises about his martial arts expertise to scare people:

Hmmm... well, kalaripayattu has a lot of similarities with caopera, alot of jumping and posturing, and a lot of religious themes to it. I guess it depends on what martial arts you've trained in to determine whether I can kick A$$ or not. let's see... I'm a red belt second degree in tae kwon do and have some knowledge in shotoken. I've got to start learning about grappling though. 

Freedom skies and myself are not the only ones who feel that Kenny is a racist. Here are some excerpts from users from other forums:

(The Armchair Analyst - Asia Times Forum)
I see. However, you sounded like a racist.
No, I have no """"South Asian sensitivities"""". I am no nationalist/jingoist. I consider myself above it all. 

ALL your posts are based on the rather silly assumption that militaristic power in the last three centuries is a sign of """"greatness"""". It may be in a narrow Anglo-saxon way, but not in a Gandhi-Buddha sort of a way. Get it?

Civilizations such as India (actually even China until today) have NEVER had a negative impact on other civilizations that remotely matches yours.

You have generalized Indians to be bigots etc., I agree that SOME not all are. But the fact that you generalized it to include an entire ethnic group as """"obnoxious"""", by definition makes you a racist. YES IT DOES! 

(rocky - Asia Times Forum)
What inaccuracy are you referring to? If Brits came to India and got rich, was the wealth Indian or British? Besides looting, what exactly did British accomplish? While your bias is clearly visible with this statement, what is your purpose of posting this in this forum?

Isnt it quiet evident that even in yr 2005, it is difficult for you to get off your pompus ass, why on earth would anything written by Anglo-Saxon when Europeans were busy colonizing the world accurate? Isnt there a vested interest on part of the European to disparage Native Cultures and delibrately belittle their achievements? 

That's just a couple of the many others. However, I do not want to clog up this page.

I have also noticed that Kenny tends to have a habit of cutting and pasting articles, and also cloning the article he had fabricated on a few web sites  I know that I am not the only one who knows this:'(Brahman - Martial Arts Planet Forum)i really do hate to post on this topic seems as it was only to counter mine, which by the way it would be nice if you would simply post this on my topic were you could get a real discusion, were as here people might simply ignore you becuase of the topic cloning.

I thought it was simpler to refer to her as just *Amy* throughout rather than explain the changes that occurred with her name & styles, but was told it was against WP *rules* (though I wasn't pointed to a link for it).
